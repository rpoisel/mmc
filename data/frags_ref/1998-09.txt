We ask you to support them inthis effort and show them the same patience and kindness you have shown us overthe last few years.The proposed date and time of the move will be Monday, 29 June, 1998. Weapologize in advance for any inconvenience this changeover will cause to listmembers; we have taken several steps (detailed below) to reduce thisinconvenience as much as possible.=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=ABOUT THE CHANGEOVERTo facilitate the move and to clean up the membership list, we are asking allmembers to subscribe to the new mailing list and to unsubscribe from the oldone. PLEASE NOTE:  You need to make this change yourself; we will *not* do itfor you. Members may make the change to the new list at anytime as of theposting of this message. Instructions for subscribing to the new mailing listand unsubscribing from the old one follow at the end of this message.Prior to the changeover date, we will forward all messages sent to the old listto the members of the new list. However, until the time of the changeover, allpostings must be sent to the old list. Consequently, those individualsinterested in posting to the list should maintain membership in the old listuntil the changeover date and then change their subscriptions after thechangeover has been made.At the changeover date we will reverse the message flow. From that date, and fora one week period thereafter, we will forward all messages sent from the newlist to the membership remaining on the old list. After the changeover date,however, all postings will have to be sent to the new list; messages sent to theold mailing list will not be forwarded to the new list in order to avoid thepotential for looping messages.=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=HOW TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE NEW NIH-IMAGE MAILING LIST:To subscribe to the new nih-image mailing list, you need to do one of thefollowing, depending on whether you wish to receive regular postings (eachposting is sent individually) or a digested version (where you receive onecomposite posting per day). **Please note** that the commands are somewhatdifferent from the old list.:To SUBSCRIBE to the REGULAR LIST, send E-mail to:     nih-image-request@biomed.drexel.eduThe Subject of the message should contain "Subscribe"As in: To: nih-image-request@biomed.drexel.eduSubject: subscribeTo SUBSCRIBE to A DIGESTED VERSION of the list, send E-mail to:     nih-image-d-request@biomed.drexel.edu.The Subject of the message should contain "Subscribe".As in: To: nih-image-d-request@biomed.drexel.eduSubject: subscribe=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=HOW TO UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THE OLD NIH-IMAGE MAILING LIST:To unsubscribe, send an email message to:     listproc@soils.umn.eduwith the message body:     unsubscribe nih-imageIf you have difficulties in unsubscribing, please notify the list-owner at:     owner-nih-image@soils.umn.eduand provide a copy of the message returned by the list processor following theunsuccessful attempt as well as your full name and, if possible, the exact emailaddress by which you originally subscribed to nih-image. We will gladly removeyou from the list.=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=PLEASE REMEMBER:The old mailing list will be shut down on Monday, 6 July, 1998 (or sooner if allmembers have unsubscribed before then). Message forwarding to the old list willcease at that time. Those individuals who have failed to subscribe to the newmailing list at that time will no longer receive postings from the mailing list.From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Fri Jun 26 00:38 EDT 1998X-UIDL: 84ba265a9f0fb37d8ca46162868140efReceived: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id AAA29345	for cshtest; Fri, 26 Jun 1998 00:38:29 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Fri, 26 Jun 1998 00:38:29 -0400 (EDT)Date: Thu, 25 Jun 1998 23:38:01 -0500 (CDT)Message-Id: <199806260439.MAA12394@nero.rph.health.wa.gov.au>Reply-To: nih-image@soils.umn.eduOriginator: nih-image@soils.umn.eduSender: nih-image@soils.umn.eduFrom: "Robert Day" <robday@rph.health.wa.gov.au>To: Multiple recipients of list <nih-image@soils.umn.edu>Subject: Re: Sony LANC protocolX-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios KotsikonasX-Comment:  NIH Image Distribution ListIn-reply-to: <1.5.4.16.19980625075403.561788ea@31d.marlab.ac.uk>Content-transfer-encoding: 7BITMIME-Version: 1.0Resent-Message-ID: <"FLHh7.0._97.vMoar"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/11X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCIIContent-Length:   350Status: RO> > I am looking for information about the LANC or Control-L protocol> which is used to control video recorders.> Chris, try the Sony LANC/Control-L page at: <http://www.york.ac.uk/~adv3/lanc/lanc.htm>Rob Day--Robert Day		rob.day@nero.rph.health.wa.gov.auProject Bioengineer	ph  +61 8 9224 3227Royal Perth Hospital	fax +61 8 9224 1138From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Fri Jun 26 12:32 EDT 1998X-UIDL: f431754d23698ef7fbe5f358fc4466eaReceived: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id MAA01752	for cshtest; Fri, 26 Jun 1998 12:32:30 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Fri, 26 Jun 1998 12:32:30 -0400 (EDT)Date: Fri, 26 Jun 1998 11:29:07 -0500 (CDT)Message-Id: <3593CBE0.322AB815@soils.umn.edu>Reply-To: nih-image@soils.umn.eduOriginator: nih-image@soils.umn.eduSender: nih-image@soils.umn.eduFrom: Ed Nater <ed.nater@soils.umn.edu>To: Multiple recipients of list <nih-image@soils.umn.edu>Subject: IMPORTANT:  The NIH-Image mailing list is movingX-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios KotsikonasX-Comment:  NIH Image Distribution ListMIME-Version: 1.0X-Mailer: Mozilla 4.05 (Macintosh; U; PPC)Resent-Message-ID: <"AHEOe.0.IP.8pyar"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/12X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: textContent-Length:  2858Status: ROContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; x-mac-type="54455854"; x-mac-creator="4D4F5353"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit!!

But I believe it could be interesting for some of you.As some of you may know, I own a small website that deals with the primarytopic of methods in the area of Heart & Vessel Research. I am writing youto tell you that I added a mailing list just for the topic of Heart &Vessel Research to my Internetserver (http://www.hvresearch.com). I had theimpression that people are interested in communicating, but are not willingto use the guestbook for this purpose. Since I believe that communicationis the most important issue in our business I installed this Listserver.I would like to ask you to help me with the initial etablishment of thelist. For most of us it is nice to subscribe to a mailing list and read themails coming in for a while, before participating actively in thediscussion. That is may main concern. People will probably unsubscribebefore a proper discussion can develop. Your task would be to have an openear for people on the list and to help when you think help is possible.To subscribe to the list just send an email to	requests@hvresearch.comwith	subscribe listservas the body of the message.I appreciate your help !... and feel free to give this adress to as many people as you can ;-)Best Regards, PeterFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Sun Jun 28 02:56 EDT 1998X-UIDL: b051232c3129d443902eeab47bc5252eReceived: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id CAA08511;	Sun, 28 Jun 1998 02:54:26 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Sun, 28 Jun 1998 02:54:26 -0400 (EDT)Date: Sun, 28 Jun 1998 01:50:54 -0500 (CDT)Message-Id: <199806280611.BAA08392@catena.soils.umn.edu>Reply-To: nih-image@soils.umn.eduOriginator: nih-image@soils.umn.eduSender: nih-image@soils.umn.eduFrom: John Ladwig <jladwig@soils.umn.edu>To: Multiple recipients of list <nih-image@soils.umn.edu>Subject: Administrivia: Getting on, off and around the listX-Listprocessor-Version: 6.0c -- ListProcessor by Anastasios KotsikonasX-Comment:  NIH Image Distribution ListResent-Message-ID: <"rfqb33.0.s_1.dVUbr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/14X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: textContent-Length:  3701Status: ROThis message is automatically posted once per month, on the 28th ofthe month.

Using a pink or salmon filter might help you enhance thepurple contrast and blend the pink into the background so that you cancount only precursor cells. Selectively capturing pink relative to darkpurple might be trickier, but I suppose you could count total cells andsubtract the counts of the immature ones to get the mature erythrocytecount. I don't think using a blue filter would differentiate the pink frompurple too well, but you might try it.The other possibility might be to capture your color image into photoshopand then use different color channels, but again I don't know how well pinkand purple will be separated.Good luck!David MorilakDavid Morilak, Ph.D.Dept of PharmacologyUniv Texas Health Science Center7703 Floyd Curl DriveSan Antonio, TX 78284-7764ph: 210-567-4174FAX: 210-567-4303E-mail: morilak@uthscsa.eduFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Jul  7 10:56 EDT 1998X-UIDL: a75023fc7aada93e3fb0d42fcebe5aa9Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id KAA21147;	Tue, 7 Jul 1998 10:55:31 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Tue, 7 Jul 1998 10:55:31 -0400 (EDT)X-Authentication-Warning: sunrise.ccs.yorku.ca: rethoret owned process doing -bsDate: Tue, 7 Jul 1998 10:46:40 -0400 (EDT)From: Karen Rethoret <rethoret@yorku.ca>X-Sender: rethoret@sunrise.ccs.yorku.caTo: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Perimeter and area measurementMessage-ID: <Pine.GSO.3.96.980707103800.22752A-100000@sunrise.ccs.yorku.ca>MIME-Version: 1.0Resent-Message-ID: <"ARJrV3.0.ju4.LJZer"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/32X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCIIContent-Length:   564Status: ROHi,We are using NIH-Image for PC, and are currently doing freehand linedrawing around cell structures in LM and would like to measure theperimeter in segments, the total perimeter and enclosed area all in onecontinuous operation.At the moment, we are using the Freehand/segmented line selection to makemeasurements of the segments and then redrawing the perimeter using theFreehand Region Tool to get the total perimeter and area measurements.Is it possible to avoid redrawing the area a second time?Thanks,Karen RethoretYork University, TorontoFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Jul  7 11:39 EDT 1998X-UIDL: 44ca9d5610d162ca5798eca7e2ef0ac9Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id LAA26276;	Tue, 7 Jul 1998 11:38:35 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Tue, 7 Jul 1998 11:38:35 -0400 (EDT)Message-Id: <3.0.1.32.19980707112824.0069a210@pop.service.ohio-state.edu>X-Sender: jianshi@pop.service.ohio-state.eduX-Mailer: Windows Eudora Pro Version 3.0.1 (32)Date: Tue, 07 Jul 1998 11:28:24 -0400To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduFrom: "j. s." <jianshi@pop.service.ohio-state.edu>Subject: CCD cameraIn-Reply-To: <l03130300b1c797fb62ac@[129.111.17.122]>References: <199807071009.GAA22450@io.ECE.Drexel.EDU>Mime-Version: 1.0Resent-Message-ID: <"Y3qDW2.0.o66.ovZer"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/33X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/enriched; charset="us-ascii"Content-Length:   535Status: ROIs there anybody who knows area CCD (white/black) system?

That is, a number of labelled, outlined, 128-greyed, areas =corresponding to each of the particles that are not touching the edges. =(The latter are also 128-greyed, but are not counted).However, when I analyze the same image, using the same macro (and =therefore the same Analyze Options) on the "headache" computer, all the =image frame, including the 2-pixel-wide particle boundaries are greyed =to 128gl. And no particle is counted.I've tried a number of different Analyze options (I played with all the =possible combinations of "ignore" and "include"), but can not reproduce =the results I obtain on my "healthy" computer.Moreover, the AnalyzeParticles command seems to realize that I am =bewildered, as it is adding a little of a quiz to the problem:I am able to get the "expected results" on my headache computer, with =the original AnalyzeOptions settings when I edit my image adding a very =wide (30 pixels) border all around the image.Please, notice that if the border is only 1, 2, 10 or even 15 pixels =wide, I obtain the headache results.=20Is there anything that I am missing?Could it be because of the NIH-image version that I am using?Or, because of some little differences between different NIH versions?Are there any options that I am missing?I appreciate all your attention this far, and thank you in =advance.From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Jul  7 18:20 EDT 1998X-UIDL: 8607deb6f7e44e515a5257cad7fe51b6Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id SAA04947;	Tue, 7 Jul 1998 18:19:33 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Tue, 7 Jul 1998 18:19:33 -0400 (EDT)Message-Id: <3.0.5.32.19980707181646.007e1650@mohawk.net>X-Sender: microbill@mohawk.netX-Mailer: QUALCOMM Windows Eudora Pro Version 3.0.5 (32)Date: Tue, 07 Jul 1998 18:16:46 -0400To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduFrom: Bill Miller <microbill@mohawk.net>Subject: Re: CCD cameraIn-Reply-To: <3.0.1.32.19980707112824.0069a210@pop.service.ohio-state.ed	u>References: <l03130300b1c797fb62ac@[129.111.17.122]>	<199807071009.GAA22450@io.ECE.Drexel.EDU>Mime-Version: 1.0Resent-Message-ID: <"oSzFp1.0.A11.gsfer"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/35X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/enriched; charset="us-ascii"Content-Length:   792Status: ROSee Electrim - http://www.electrim.com  and DVChttp://members.aol.com/dvcco/Both are affordable and do at least what you want - probably more.Best Regards - Bill MillerAt 11:28 AM 7/7/98 -0400, you wrote:>>>> <excerpt>Is there anybody who knows area CCD (white/black) system?

I am using a lowlight level, SIT 66 camera from DAGE-mti, Inc., and capturing the imageswith NIH-Image on a PowerMac G3.  Specs for the computer are 32 Meg RAM,266MHz, and 512K.  The frame grabber is an LG3 from Scion.The problem I am running into is that the images I'm getting areincredibly grainy.  In fact, they look worse on the computer screen thanthey do when looking through the microscope.  Is there any way to changethe parameters (preferences) of the camera function?The other question I have is, is there a way to set the software tocapture frames at timed intervals? I would like to be able to take shortexposures at timed intervals.  For example, take a 0.1 second exposureevery 10 sec.  Is there a way to do this?  So far whenever I set theexposure time the software automatically changes the number of framesper second.  For example, when I set the camera for a 0.1 secondexposure, the software then automatically sets the computer to capture10 frames per second.  The problem with this is that I very rapidlyreach the memory limit of the computer and thus cannot capture imagesover a long period of time (ie. several minutes).

Before we chanced upon NIH though, wepurchased an Image Analyser (together with a Fluorescence microscope) fromLeica. The PC unit (a 486 but, due to problems, upgraded with a Pentiumprocessor only) with its frame grabber (Elvis, 16 bit) has given us moreproblems than we care to mention. It has been shipped to the UK twice andis now currently with the local agents in another city.To cut a long story short, the agents are offering us a new Pentium II 166MX with Matrox framegrabber (32 bit) and latest QWin Pro software (includesQWin gallery) at a price tag of R20,000 (about $3,225).One of the biggest problems we had with the old system was to get itnetworked, with the local agent stating emphatically that we could notnetwork.  The Pentium on offer will apparantly network, but we would needto buy the ethernet card as an extra.My feeling is that we should rather buy a decent framegrabber for the AppleMac (am I right in thinking that one could get a similar card to the Matroxcard at around $3,000?). The camera we use (JVC colour) gives S-video andcomposite output . We could then use NIH-Image (which I think in manyrespects is better than QWin). Networking also would be problem free.I would appreciate any suggestions in this regard, but basically we seem tobe spending an endless amount of money on a system which is more out oforder than in order.Specifically, I would appreciate advice on which framegrabber card would besuitable for hires colour grabbing on the Mac.Thakns in advance.____________________________________________________________________PAUL A HUMAN, M.Sc.Deputy DirectorCardiovascular Research UnitUniversity of Cape Town Medical SchoolOBSERVATORY 7925, Cape Town, South AfricaVoice:+27-21-406 6418  Fax:+27-21-448 5935  Cell:+27-82-770 3612From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Thu Jul 16 10:01 EDT 1998X-UIDL: d706125342e3f44d2f4714480e76208eReceived: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id KAA04268;	Thu, 16 Jul 1998 10:01:43 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Thu, 16 Jul 1998 10:01:43 -0400 (EDT)From: Vaughn Adams <vaughn@cbis.ece.drexel.edu>Message-Id: <199807161351.JAA28577@cbis.ece.drexel.edu>Subject: Re: nih-image-d Digest V98 #11In-Reply-To: <35ADD486.E0B71177@elis.rug.ac.be> from "Tom Vanzieleghem" at "Jul 16, 98 12:23:03 pm"X-ELM-OSV: (Our standard violations) no-mime=1; no-hdr-encoding=1To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduDate: Thu, 16 Jul 1998 09:51:21 -0400 (EDT)X-Mailer: ELM [version 2.4ME+ PL31 (25)]Resent-Message-ID: <"VGa0w.0.Oo.YLWhr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/58X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: textContent-Length:   444Status: ROTom:> How can I cancel my subscription to this list ?Sure.

Since your camera only outputsS-video and composite (NTSC I assume), you can probably get a good frame grabberfor less than $1500 US, unless you are planning to upgrade to a RGB camera sometime in the next few years.  As George Peters mentioned, the Scion boards are agood choice for use with NIH-Image.  Chris TullyPaul Human wrote:> > Dear Imager> > We run an exclusive Apple Mac network and use NIH-Image (and some of the> spin-off programmes) regularly.

Non-biologists seeking a comprehensive introduction to microscopy and video-imaging will benefit greatly from this course aswell. There are no specific prerequisites, but an understanding of the basic principles of optics is desirable. Limited to 24 students.  The eight day course consists of lectures, laboratory demonstrations, exercises and discussions that will enable the participant to obtain and interpret microscope images of high quality, to perform quantitativeoptical measurements, and to produce photographic and video records fordocumentation and analysis.Topics to be covered include:      principles of microscope design and image formation      bright field, dark field, phase contrast, differential         interference contrast, interference reflection, and          fluorescence microscopy      confocal scanning microscopy and image deconvolution      digital image restoration and 3-D reconstruction      video imaging, recording, enhancement, and intensification      analog and digital image processing and analysis      fluorescent probes and ratio-imaging      laser tweezers and laser scissors  Applications to live cells will be emphasized; other specimens will be covered as well.  Students will have direct hands-on experience with state-of-the-art microscopes, video cameras, recorders and image processing equipmentprovided by major optical and electronics companies. Instruction will beprovided by experienced staff from universities and industry.  Students are encouraged to bring their own biological (primary cultures, cell lines, etc.) and material specimens and to discussindividual research problems with the faculty.From nih-image-d-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Jul 21 11:05 EDT 1998X-UIDL: a23ebc6aeffa6dde6992a459c1243d16Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id LAA28869;	Tue, 21 Jul 1998 11:05:16 -0400 (EDT)Date: Tue, 21 Jul 1998 11:05:16 -0400 (EDT)From: nih-image-d-request@io.ece.drexel.eduMessage-Id: <199807211505.LAA28869@io.ECE.Drexel.EDU>Subject: nih-image-d Digest V98 #16X-Loop: nih-image-d@biomed.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image-d@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/volume98/16Precedence: listMIME-Version: 1.0To: nih-image-d@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: multipart/digest; boundary="----------------------------"Content-Length: 11623Status: RO------------------------------Content-Type: text/plainnih-image-d Digest				Volume 98 : Issue 16Today's Topics:  movie help                            [ Jim G Thomas <jgthomas@wam.umd.edu> ]  help with LG-3                        [ Francesc Peters <cesc@cucafera.icm. ]  median stack                          [ Bruce Berkowitz <baberko@med.wayne. ]  Re: NIH Image for the MAC             [ Carl Gustafson <carl.gustafson@cbis ]  Re: help with LG-3                    [ Carl Gustafson <carl.gustafson@cbis ]  Re: Digest Form                       [ David Milstone <milstone@rascal.med ]  Course Announcement                   [ "R.

I have a power mac 7600 with 32meg ram.  I am running NIH image 1.61with around 19meg allocated towards it.  My problem is that I can makestandard movies just fine when I have the picture size at 1/4 (in VideoControl).  If I increase the picture size to 1/2 or full-size I canstill see what is being captured, though it is quite slow.  But when Itry to make a movie, all I get is a black window and hence a black movie.Any ideas?  Is this just a memory problem?  Or I am not properlyconfigured.  I do not have scion, if that makes a difference.jim thomas------------------------------Date: Tue, 21 Jul 1998 11:59:30 +0200From: Francesc Peters <cesc@cucafera.icm.csic.es>To: support@scioncorp.com, nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: help with LG-3Message-Id: <l03130300b1da12b46ed5@[193.145.218.128]>Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"Hi,We just bought an LG-3 and installed it in a new PowerMac G3 (desktop)running MacOS 8.0.

Non-biologists seeking a comprehensive introduction to microscopy and video-imaging will benefit greatly from this course aswell. There are no specific prerequisites, but an understanding of the basic principles of optics is desirable. Limited to 24 students.  The eight day course consists of lectures, laboratory demonstrations, exercises and discussions that will enable the participant to obtain and interpret microscope images of high quality, to perform quantitativeoptical measurements, and to produce photographic and video records fordocumentation and analysis.Topics to be covered include:      principles of microscope design and image formation      bright field, dark field, phase contrast, differential         interference contrast, interference reflection, and          fluorescence microscopy      confocal scanning microscopy and image deconvolution      digital image restoration and 3-D reconstruction      video imaging, recording, enhancement, and intensification      analog and digital image processing and analysis      fluorescent probes and ratio-imaging      laser tweezers and laser scissors  Applications to live cells will be emphasized; other specimens will be covered as well.  Students will have direct hands-on experience with state-of-the-art microscopes, video cameras, recorders and image processing equipmentprovided by major optical and electronics companies. Instruction will beprovided by experienced staff from universities and industry.  Students are encouraged to bring their own biological (primary cultures, cell lines, etc.) and material specimens and to discussindividual research problems with the faculty.--------------------------------End of nih-image-d Digest V98 Issue #16***************************************From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Jul 21 11:17 EDT 1998X-UIDL: c8ea1d9360d367b1e561ee212ba2893bReceived: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id LAA00065;	Tue, 21 Jul 1998 11:16:34 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Tue, 21 Jul 1998 11:16:34 -0400 (EDT)Mime-Version: 1.0X-Sender: rwadkins@wwwctrc.fs.saci.orgMessage-Id: <v04011700b1da7bc0c61f@[192.238.18.184]>In-Reply-To: <199807211449.KAA27112@io.ECE.Drexel.EDU>Date: Tue, 21 Jul 1998 10:12:13 -0700To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduFrom: "Randy M.

Thatdoesn't sound like a median image to me, but if that is what you want then itis easy (but slow) to do. You will have to use a sort procedure in your macroto get the median (and then since you have an even number of images will haveto probably average the 5th and 6th ranked values).From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Jul 21 16:33 EDT 1998X-UIDL: 424f9e38db634aff4488d39f2c98061cReceived: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id QAA23350;	Tue, 21 Jul 1998 16:32:55 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Tue, 21 Jul 1998 16:32:55 -0400 (EDT)From: "Grace,John" <John.Grace@add.ssw.abbott.com>To: <nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu>Subject: Sum of Values in particle analysisMessage-Id: <0055600001401889000002L092*@MHS>Date: Tue, 21 Jul 1998 15:24:36 -0500Mime-Version: 1.0Content-Disposition: inlineContent-Transfer-Encoding: 8bitX-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU id QAA22403Resent-Message-ID: <"WZiKW1.0.GU5.LZFjr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/94X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1Content-Length:   394Status: RODear imagers,I am trying to find the amount of ink in spots printed on a card, I also wantthe degree of variation/uniformity of the coating of these spots.

This should producewhite spots where the voids are on a black background.  The only possibleproblem with this approach is if the samples are too delicate to be handled inthis fashion.2) The computational approcah:  Choose 'Anaylze Particles' from the Analyzemenu, and select 'Include interior holes.'  This should treat the black centerof your voids as a hole in a white particle, and give you the measurements youwant.

We were considering the Dage VE 1000 SIT system, butthen heard that Dage-MTI was getting out of the "Scientificimaging" and/or perhaps the "SIT camera" market(s); and havebeen advised to avoid them. Any truth to this?Furthermore, we've been told the Hamamatsu 2400-8 system comeswith no choice of tube grade (but most likely a grade 2). Is this also true?Any additional thoughts about these cameras, and/or the Argus-20DSP versus the Dage-MTI DSP-2000 would be appreciated.Thanks in advace,Aaron-- R.

This should producewhite spots where the voids are on a black background.  The only possibleproblem with this approach is if the samples are too delicate to be handled inthis fashion.2) The computational approcah:  Choose 'Anaylze Particles' from the Analyzemenu, and select 'Include interior holes.'  This should treat the black centerof your voids as a hole in a white particle, and give you the measurements youwant.  The only problem here would be if the boundry is thin enough that it hasbreaks in it, preventing the program from identifying the border as an object.Chris TullyImage Processing ConsultantKanu P Singh wrote:> > Hi!> > I am trying to use NIH Image to analyze void sizes in my SEM mcrographs of> hardened phenol-formaldehyde resin ( a thermosetting polymer).

We found a peak FI value at 2mM fluorescien. However we had to overcome a couple of problems to "standardize" the technique.1) We used neutral density filters and low magnification to mimimize photobleaching effects. We checked this by plotting the FI against time of exposure to UV light.2) Because of light extinction with depth we first did a saggital scan to find the brightest point. We then frame averaged at that point and used the average FI of the field for our value.3) Because the FI varies with light intensity and contrast settings etc. we calibrated just before taking the measurements.Other things to be careful with - fluorescien FI is stronglyinfluenced by pH. We found FI decreased with alginate concentration this could be due to reduced pH or possible changes in density. This work is reported in:deBeer, D., Stoodley, P., and Lewandowski, Z. 1997. "Measurement of local diffusion coefficients in biofilms by micro-injection and confocal microscopy." Biotech. and Bioeng. 53(2):151-158.We were only interested in relating the relative changes of FI to relative changes in fluorescien concentration - not making absolute measurements. Confocal laser microscopy is also much more controlled than conventional fluorescence. However, if you are very careful with your calibration steps and run the right controls you might be able to get something.

You can do a pretty good job isolating parts of a color image withthese selection tools. How does Photoshop define a color range and sortpixels by that definition?

Unfortunately, this is not the caseMark, I found these comments very thought-provoking.excuse my probable ignorance or niaivity, isn't hue angle related in someway to wavelength in many cases?I realise the pixels on our screens are mixtures of rgb, but they usuallydo not represent mixtures of rgb brought in from the real world. Unless weare using spectrophotometers, electronically we most often representwavelengths in the real world in rgb because it is convenient to sample itand then display it that way.If I digitally photograph or frame grab a sodium yellow flame, isn't thehue of the resulting image some sort of representation of the originalwavelength(s)?So if I had a table which converted hue angle to wavelength, perhaps Icould create a real-values image in which pixel values represented thecentres of wavelength ranges. Once I had made the table, I could code itinto Image for all to use (:-) ? Maybe all you need is hue angle, butwavelength ranges may not be related in a very linear way to hue, I haven'ttried to figure that out.I am sure there can be lots of dangers in this approach (mixed lightsources etc.) and I am sure the list will hear about them 5 minutes afterthis is posted! This could still help out all those people who post to thelist asking how to separate their coloured stains / leaf colours / etc.I hope this promotes some discussioneven if it is only that I have just re-invented a wheel called hue!SteveFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Wed Jul 22 22:48 EDT 1998X-UIDL: e172c4ed296bdb0b88d5b9b1c530d13dReceived: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id WAA12866;	Wed, 22 Jul 1998 22:47:27 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Wed, 22 Jul 1998 22:47:27 -0400 (EDT)Date: Wed, 22 Jul 1998 21:30:35 -0500From: scidi <scidi@mci2000.com>Subject: Integration on the LG-3 NuBus CardTo: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-to: scidi@mci2000.comMessage-id: <0EWJ00NUI0NM4Y@PM02SM.PMM.MCI.NET>MIME-version: 1.0X-Mailer: Microsoft Internet Mail 4.70.1161Content-transfer-encoding: 7bitX-MSMail-Priority: NormalX-Priority: 3Resent-Message-ID: <"bYGd42.0.Qv2.r8gjr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/118X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1Content-Length:   603Status: ROTo NIH Users:I have recently installed NuBus LG-3 and TV-3 cards in my Power Mac 7100. I have had relatively few problems, except that when I go to Integrate onChip, I get a printout on the Mitsubishi thermal printer that came with thesystem instead of the on chip integration.

Fundamentally what a scientist really needs is to know is: whichpixels, or how many pixels, or what percent, have a dominant wavelengthbetween 400 and 500 nm wavelength (or whatever range). It would be easierif pixels were not RGB or HSV, or anything else unrelated. Instead theyshould be wavelength(s) and density. Unfortunately, this is not the casebut is sort or roughly like that with RGB and then the density isincorportated and things are sort of lumped all up and its a mess.I once wrote a macro which looked at the LUT to find which pixels have moreof R than G or B. I then sought and counted those pixels in the image. Thisis sort of roughly what you request. Don't know if I can find it because itwas years ago, but thats how I would still implement what you ask.Mark------------------------------Date: Wed, 22 Jul 1998 10:06:20 -0400 (EDT)From: Jon Vaughan <jvaughan@hamilton.edu>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Digest form in elm on unix machineMessage-Id: <199807221406.KAA11385@hamilton.edu>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCIIContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitI read the digest using the 'elm' mail program on a unix machine (ELM 2.4 PL25, using 'more' to page through messages.Because the digest comes through as a multi-part MIME message, until now I have had to read through all the messages of the digest formatof the list, but I have discovered how to skip the messages I don't wantto read: at the    --Press any key to go on.--prompt, press the control-c (^C) key combination, and the remainder of the message(s) will be skipped. -- Jonathan Vaughan       Psychology, Hamilton College        jvaughan@hamilton.edu------------------------------Date: Wed, 22 Jul 1998 15:29:57 +0100 (GMT Daylight Time)From: paul stoodley <P.Stoodley@exeter.ac.uk>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.educc: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Re: Image density??Message-ID: <SIMEON.9807221557.A@BS016.ex.ac.uk>Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCIIWe calibrated the relative fluorescence intensity [FI] of different concentrations of fluorescein measured by confocal microscopy. We found a peak FI value at 2mM fluorescien. However we had to overcome a couple of problems to "standardize" the technique.1) We used neutral density filters and low magnification to mimimize photobleaching effects. We checked this by plotting the FI against time of exposure to UV light.2) Because of light extinction with depth we first did a saggital scan to find the brightest point. We then frame averaged at that point and used the average FI of the field for our value.3) Because the FI varies with light intensity and contrast settings etc. we calibrated just before taking the measurements.Other things to be careful with - fluorescien FI is stronglyinfluenced by pH. We found FI decreased with alginate concentration this could be due to reduced pH or possible changes in density. This work is reported in:deBeer, D., Stoodley, P., and Lewandowski, Z. 1997. "Measurement of local diffusion coefficients in biofilms by micro-injection and confocal microscopy." Biotech. and Bioeng. 53(2):151-158.We were only interested in relating the relative changes of FI to relative changes in fluorescien concentration - not making absolute measurements. Confocal laser microscopy is also much more controlled than conventional fluorescence. However, if you are very careful with your calibration steps and run the right controls you might be able to get something.

Unfortunately, this is not the caseMark, I found these comments very thought-provoking.excuse my probable ignorance or niaivity, isn't hue angle related in someway to wavelength in many cases?I realise the pixels on our screens are mixtures of rgb, but they usuallydo not represent mixtures of rgb brought in from the real world. Unless weare using spectrophotometers, electronically we most often representwavelengths in the real world in rgb because it is convenient to sample itand then display it that way.If I digitally photograph or frame grab a sodium yellow flame, isn't thehue of the resulting image some sort of representation of the originalwavelength(s)?So if I had a table which converted hue angle to wavelength, perhaps Icould create a real-values image in which pixel values represented thecentres of wavelength ranges. Once I had made the table, I could code itinto Image for all to use (:-) ? Maybe all you need is hue angle, butwavelength ranges may not be related in a very linear way to hue, I haven'ttried to figure that out.I am sure there can be lots of dangers in this approach (mixed lightsources etc.) and I am sure the list will hear about them 5 minutes afterthis is posted! This could still help out all those people who post to thelist asking how to separate their coloured stains / leaf colours / etc.I hope this promotes some discussioneven if it is only that I have just re-invented a wheel called hue!Steve------------------------------Date: Wed, 22 Jul 1998 21:30:35 -0500From: scidi <scidi@mci2000.com>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Integration on the LG-3 NuBus CardMessage-id: <0EWJ00NUI0NM4Y@PM02SM.PMM.MCI.NET>Content-type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1Content-transfer-encoding: 7bitTo NIH Users:I have recently installed NuBus LG-3 and TV-3 cards in my Power Mac 7100. I have had relatively few problems, except that when I go to Integrate onChip, I get a printout on the Mitsubishi thermal printer that came with thesystem instead of the on chip integration.

Roughly the answer seems tobe yes. Specifically I think the answer is not very well. It would be truerfor example if R was a wavelength value from 0 to 255 (or 0 to 100, or 600to 700 nm) which represented the redness or red wavelengths of of a point,same for G and B, and you had seperately an intensity plane to take care ofdensity. Roughly though I think what you say gives as good a simple answeras can be gotten without forming new image standards and and using aspectrophotometer, etc. I think using hue might do better.MarkFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Thu Jul 23 10:45 EDT 1998X-UIDL: ef94e1c7985673372209e938b4456642Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id KAA16956;	Thu, 23 Jul 1998 10:45:24 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 10:45:24 -0400 (EDT)X-SMTP-Posting-Origin: grains.mcgill.ca ([132.206.29.33])Message-Id: <3.0.5.32.19980723103438.007a6950@po-box.mcgill.ca>X-Sender: mayoub@po-box.mcgill.caX-Mailer: QUALCOMM Windows Eudora Light Version 3.0.5 (32)Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 10:34:38 -0400To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduFrom: Micheline Ayoub <mayoub@po-box.mcgill.ca>Subject: Fourier DescriptorsMime-Version: 1.0Resent-Message-ID: <"q55l-3.0.4v3.Teqjr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/122X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"Content-Length:   527Status: ROHi there,I am looking for a software that can apply Fourier descriptors in ima0geanalysis.

How do you know if theoriginal color was red plus green or true yellow from an RGB picture? Thatis not possible. To really select only yellow, you would have to have anarrow band-pass filter for only yellow (the exact wavelength). The problemis that yellow light excites green as well as red cones in the eye (and the-broad band- elemnts in a RGB camera) and the brain interprets this asyellow. But the brain also interprets a mix of true (narrow band) red andtrue green as yellow. So, in contrast to the ear, the eye (and camera) doesnot register the wavelenth of the light, only the relative excitation ofthe three types of color-sensitive cones. No way to convert the RGBinformation back to wavelength. The problem remains the same irrespectivethe color representation (RGB, HSI, etc), all color representations containbasically the same information, and are interchangable.ArnoutFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Thu Jul 23 14:42 EDT 1998X-UIDL: 66564c3908ddf0b35ecf6fbd66d04ca1Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id OAA07966;	Thu, 23 Jul 1998 14:41:43 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 14:41:43 -0400 (EDT)Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 11:23:53 -0700 (PDT)From: David Ehrhardt <ehrhardt@camelot.Stanford.EDU>Reply-To: David Ehrhardt <ehrhardt@camelot.Stanford.EDU>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Re: pixel rangeIn-Reply-To: <35B6C23B.F9AF6BCF@sisna.com>Message-ID: <Pine.GUL.3.95.980723105602.3221B-100000@camelot.Stanford.EDU>MIME-Version: 1.0Resent-Message-ID: <"Y05IM3.0.Yd1.c3ujr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/126X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCIIContent-Length:  1707Status: ROThe histogram appraoch does not really answer the question here.

Just read this myself in "Seeing the Light, Optics in Nature,Photography, Color, Vision and Holography" by David Falk. Wiley books. Niceeasy to read, unlike most IP books.He shows on page 242 how a 590nm and a mix of 550 and 690 look the same tothe eye.Oh well, I guess we need a 3D volume to represent a 2D plane. Have width,height and 300 planes of wavelength for each image. Anything less is aguess.MarkFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Thu Jul 23 15:44 EDT 1998X-UIDL: b643d708036c1b26881692759e74ee2eReceived: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id PAA12910;	Thu, 23 Jul 1998 15:44:10 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 15:44:10 -0400 (EDT)Message-Id: <199807231925.QAA14158@ceiun01.elogica.com.br>From: "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Rejane_Magalh=E3es_Pimentel_Galindo?=" <ggalindo@elogica.com.br>To: <nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu>Subject: Re: Fourier DescriptorsDate: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 16:18:14 -0300X-MSMail-Priority: NormalX-Priority: 3X-Mailer: Microsoft Internet Mail 4.70.1155MIME-Version: 1.0Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitResent-Message-ID: <"AHMKG.0._q2.Wxujr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/129X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1Content-Length:   976Status: RODear Micheline,I receive a message with a adress that I think have what you needSPM Image Analysishttp://www.dfm.dtu.dk/spip/Good luckRejane GalindoUniversidade Federal Rural de PernambucoPlant Morphology and Anatomy----------> From: Micheline Ayoub <mayoub@po-box.mcgill.ca>> To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu> Subject: Fourier Descriptors> Date: Quinta-feira, 23 Julho, 1998 11:34> > Hi there,> > I am looking for a software that can apply Fourier descriptors in ima0ge> analysis.

And it is all fairly painless so far.When I get it all working well I will share it.Now I can get the position of the stage by asking it where x y z , andit returns the appropriate numbers in a string which I can sort out andscale etc.The user can push a button on the joystick and this is noted by thecontroller and the postion at that point can be recorded.What I want to do is display a window or a panel in a window which showsthe three numbers with appropriate labels (X Y and Z for instance) andupdates these numbers until I tell it to stop. So that as the stage ismoved with the joystick the numbers roll and follow the position. Thefrequency of update might be limited as the stage controllercommunicates at 9600 baud. But I guess if I get an update every 0.1second or so it will be ok.Now my question.What is the best method to use in Image.A text window with big writing. How to delete the old numbers.An Image window with some hard written labels and the new numbersoverwritten.

Roughly the answer seems tobe yes. Specifically I think the answer is not very well. It would be truerfor example if R was a wavelength value from 0 to 255 (or 0 to 100, or 600to 700 nm) which represented the redness or red wavelengths of of a point,same for G and B, and you had seperately an intensity plane to take care ofdensity. Roughly though I think what you say gives as good a simple answeras can be gotten without forming new image standards and and using aspectrophotometer, etc. I think using hue might do better.Mark------------------------------Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 10:34:38 -0400From: Micheline Ayoub <mayoub@po-box.mcgill.ca>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Fourier DescriptorsMessage-Id: <3.0.5.32.19980723103438.007a6950@po-box.mcgill.ca>Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"Hi there,I am looking for a software that can apply Fourier descriptors in ima0geanalysis.

How do you know if theoriginal color was red plus green or true yellow from an RGB picture? Thatis not possible. To really select only yellow, you would have to have anarrow band-pass filter for only yellow (the exact wavelength). The problemis that yellow light excites green as well as red cones in the eye (and the-broad band- elemnts in a RGB camera) and the brain interprets this asyellow. But the brain also interprets a mix of true (narrow band) red andtrue green as yellow. So, in contrast to the ear, the eye (and camera) doesnot register the wavelenth of the light, only the relative excitation ofthe three types of color-sensitive cones. No way to convert the RGBinformation back to wavelength. The problem remains the same irrespectivethe color representation (RGB, HSI, etc), all color representations containbasically the same information, and are interchangable.Arnout------------------------------Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 11:23:53 -0700 (PDT)From: David Ehrhardt <ehrhardt@camelot.Stanford.EDU>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Re: pixel rangeMessage-ID: <Pine.GUL.3.95.980723105602.3221B-100000@camelot.Stanford.EDU>Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCIIThe histogram appraoch does not really answer the question here.  Jerineeds to know which pixels contain a particular relative amount of eachcolor component.  A pixel with a particular value of blue might be part ofsay a purple or a blue pixel.  I guess what is needed is something likewhat Arnout suggested; you classify each pixel as falling within acertain range of R AND G AND B values.  Possibly more sophisticatedselections could be made by working with relative pixel values to select ahue across darkness and lightness gradients.  -DavidOn Wed, 22 Jul 1998, Christopher P.

Just read this myself in "Seeing the Light, Optics in Nature,Photography, Color, Vision and Holography" by David Falk. Wiley books. Niceeasy to read, unlike most IP books.He shows on page 242 how a 590nm and a mix of 550 and 690 look the same tothe eye.Oh well, I guess we need a 3D volume to represent a 2D plane. Have width,height and 300 planes of wavelength for each image. Anything less is aguess.Mark------------------------------Date: Thu, 23 Jul 1998 16:18:14 -0300From: "=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Rejane_Magalh=E3es_Pimentel_Galindo?=" <ggalindo@elogica.com.br>To: <nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu>Subject: Re: Fourier DescriptorsMessage-Id: <199807231925.QAA14158@ceiun01.elogica.com.br>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitDear Micheline,I receive a message with a adress that I think have what you needSPM Image Analysishttp://www.dfm.dtu.dk/spip/Good luckRejane GalindoUniversidade Federal Rural de PernambucoPlant Morphology and Anatomy----------> From: Micheline Ayoub <mayoub@po-box.mcgill.ca>> To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu> Subject: Fourier Descriptors> Date: Quinta-feira, 23 Julho, 1998 11:34> > Hi there,> > I am looking for a software that can apply Fourier descriptors in ima0ge> analysis.

And it is all fairly painless so far.When I get it all working well I will share it.Now I can get the position of the stage by asking it where x y z , andit returns the appropriate numbers in a string which I can sort out andscale etc.The user can push a button on the joystick and this is noted by thecontroller and the postion at that point can be recorded.What I want to do is display a window or a panel in a window which showsthe three numbers with appropriate labels (X Y and Z for instance) andupdates these numbers until I tell it to stop. So that as the stage ismoved with the joystick the numbers roll and follow the position. Thefrequency of update might be limited as the stage controllercommunicates at 9600 baud. But I guess if I get an update every 0.1second or so it will be ok.Now my question.What is the best method to use in Image.A text window with big writing. How to delete the old numbers.An Image window with some hard written labels and the new numbersoverwritten. How to remove the old ones.The Info window works well but it is in a small font.So if anyone has tried this sort of thing and is willing to share theirexperience I would be grateful.Best RegardsNoel Goldsmith.--------------------------------End of nih-image-d Digest V98 Issue #19***************************************From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Fri Jul 24 09:50 EDT 1998X-UIDL: e3f5088bde99af1cc7f1cb3c8f275c61Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id JAA09492;	Fri, 24 Jul 1998 09:50:04 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Fri, 24 Jul 1998 09:50:04 -0400 (EDT)Message-ID: <19980724133612.22265.rocketmail@send1a.yahoomail.com>Date: Fri, 24 Jul 1998 06:36:12 -0700 (PDT)From: first last <w2072y@yahoo.com>Subject: brightness values over timeTo: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduMIME-Version: 1.0Resent-Message-ID: <"Z3GLV.0.m22.cu8kr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/131X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-Length:   662Status: RODear users of NIH image:I have stacks of gray scale images, representing a time lapse, and Iwould like to measure the values for the brightness of single pixelsor for the average brightness of a small ROI, respectively, for eachframe in the image stack.The results of these measurements should be written in a column to atext window for later saving to an ASCII file.I could not find a macro for doing this and I would highly appreciateany suggestions of how to write such a macro.Thank you very much in advance._________________________________________________________DO YOU YAHOO!?Get your free @yahoo.com address at http://mail.yahoo.comFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Fri Jul 24 10:08 EDT 1998X-UIDL: 93a9b8df38c71c887a8ac5ea5a75ff60Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id KAA11164;	Fri, 24 Jul 1998 10:08:43 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Fri, 24 Jul 1998 10:08:43 -0400 (EDT)Date: Fri, 24 Jul 1998 09:57:38 -0400From: "J.P.

To my dismay, we have gone with the Leicasystem due to corporate political issues and I think already we are seeingthe disadvantage of that decision. Nevertheless, we will be addingframegrabber cards to some of our existing Macs and the information thislist has provided will certainly help in this area.Secondly, we have a Apple 6500/300 with an Avid Cinema card as well as afew G3's with their standard AV input/output.

To my dismay, we have gone with the Leicasystem due to corporate political issues and I think already we are seeingthe disadvantage of that decision. Nevertheless, we will be addingframegrabber cards to some of our existing Macs and the information thislist has provided will certainly help in this area.Secondly, we have a Apple 6500/300 with an Avid Cinema card as well as afew G3's with their standard AV input/output. Although these are obviouslynot what one needs for individual framegrabs, they do nevertheless providea suitable picture (in many ways better than we are getting with the Leicasystem with its Matrox Millenium card) which would be usable for simplemorphometric analysis of LM specimens. My question is, are there driversavailable which would allow direct capture from these cards into NIH?

I have an 8600/300 running the same version of the OS with the same extensions loaded and I never have this problem.

If your PCI machine isfaster, that will counteract any overhead in the translation process, soyou will get a higher capture speed on a fast PCI with an adapter than on aslow NuBus Mac. The only PCI to NuBus adapters I know of are fromSecondWave and quite expensive ($900) so you would spend the money betteron upgrading your LG-3 card.+---------------------------------------------------------+|  Stein Roervik   (steinr@chembio.ntnu.no)               ||                                                         ||  Research Scientist, Computer Assisted Microscopy       ||  Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Norwegian University of  ||  Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway       ||  tel. +47 73 59 39 88, fax +47 73 59 08 60              |+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------Date: Tue, 04 Aug 1998 08:49:01 +1000From: John Jamieson <j.jamieson@unsw.edu.au>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Re: G3Message-Id: <3.0.5.32.19980804084901.007a31a0@pop3.unsw.edu.au>Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"I had a similar problem with a new G3 using the serial Localtalk printerconnection.

Theparticles I am analyzing are somewhat oval shaped, fairly well defined, andusually a few hundred pixels in area (they don't appear small on the screen.) Ihave been trying to get Scion to give me the lengths of the major/ minor axes ofthe best fitting oval for the particle, but every time I attempt this I geterror codes like "-1.#IO" instead of a measurement. Whether or not I havecalibrated my scale to the proper units doesn't seem to have an effect.Has anyone else had this problem? Is there some way to get the major/ minor axesto work? I even drew perfect elipses on a blank image as a test, and it didn'teven give me the measurements for that.__________________________________Alex CourtadeHuntsman Corporation7114 N.

So I've implemented the pointand click colour segmentation bit in Object Image. Click on one of the objects youwant to segment in the index colour image and Object Image will segment the RGBimage on the basis of independent density slices in each channel. Unlike Image-ProPlus, you can easily discard any of the channels you don't want. You can alsorecord your settings for use in batch processing. I still have to add a fewfeatures like the ability to segment several types of object in the same image,but if any one is interested I've sent it to Wayne for uploading to the NIH site.I welcome any feed back :-)Jeremy Brown------------------------------Date: Tue, 4 Aug 1998 17:27:44 +0200 (MET DST)From: ablocker@pasteur.fr (Ariel Blocker)To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Re: Eudora usersMessage-Id: <v01530504b1ecf51f23dd@[157.99.96.127]>Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"Dear List Managers and Users,Maybe I am stupid folks but when we swapped to the new list I, who waspreviously receiving only digests and not individual messages, startedgetting only individual messages (which is pretty troublesome when you goaway on holidays for 2 weeks and return to find your mailbox clogged upwith alomst exclusively list news).

Theparticles I am analyzing are somewhat oval shaped, fairly well defined, andusually a few hundred pixels in area (they don't appear small on the screen.) Ihave been trying to get Scion to give me the lengths of the major/ minor axes ofthe best fitting oval for the particle, but every time I attempt this I geterror codes like "-1.#IO" instead of a measurement. Whether or not I havecalibrated my scale to the proper units doesn't seem to have an effect.Has anyone else had this problem? Is there some way to get the major/ minor axesto work? I even drew perfect elipses on a blank image as a test, and it didn'teven give me the measurements for that.__________________________________Alex CourtadeHuntsman Corporation7114 N.

The normal distribution is unique so can be reconstructedknowing mean x and standard deviation.  But there are an infinite number ofdifferent curves which can generate a particular skewedness.  Admittedlythey may not be smooth.  For example if you take a normal and just pull upone channel a bit, the value of skewedness will increase.  If you drop itdown again and pull up another channel it will also increase similarly, andyou won't be able to distinguish one from the other.  So there is no uniquesolution.You might be better fitting a more explicit form to your data.   Thesimplest skewed form is the lognormal, which has a tail to larger X.

The normal distribution is unique so can be reconstructedknowing mean x and standard deviation.  But there are an infinite number ofdifferent curves which can generate a particular skewedness.  Admittedlythey may not be smooth.  For example if you take a normal and just pull upone channel a bit, the value of skewedness will increase.

However, the drive did eventually die and have to bereplaced (in fact, the replacement was DOA, and had to be replaced aswell...).3) At this point, I think long and hard before buying any more Zipdrives.  First because at 100 - 200 MB of images per experiment Zips getused up fast, and second because CD-R disks are cheaper and less proneto being killed by a defective drive.  Chris TullyGeoffrey D.

All images will be created and saved inNIH image on the Mac. I want to do this on writable CD-ROMs.I have purchased a Sony Storewell CD writer. I have tested it and it workswell. The CD writer software, Adaptec Toast, can record in both Mac andWindows/Jouliet format, and the cross-platform compatible ISO format.The writer is also bundled with Adaptec DirectCD, which allows files to bemoved, renamed and deleted while the CD is "open" using the cross-platformUDF format. This functionality is very important since I often need toreorganize files as the scope of a project changes. UDF drivers areavailable for Windows as well, so I have successfully been able to readdisks written in this format on a PC.The problem is to get some way of automatically mapping file extensions tofile types. The files are of PICT, TIFF, Excel and Word types. I want someway for the PC to read the Mac file type attributes and automatically addthe proper extensions. For various reasons, it is quite impractical to addthe extensions on the Mac side. I have purchased the utility programDataWiz MacOpener for opening Mac disks on a PC. MacOpener mounts Mac disksand adds extensions automatically as desired, but only on Mac formatteddisks. If I am going to take advantage of the incremental and changeableUDF format, which is supported both by the Mac and the PC, MacOpener doesnot add the extensions as the CD is recognized by the system as a valid PCdisk.So what I need is either some utility on the PC that will recognize Macfiles as Mac files and add proper extensions, even when the disk isreadable by the PC; or some flexible (incremental) way to write CDs in ahybrid format that automatically adds extensions to the filenames in the PCdirectory part of the shared data. The latter solution is probably the bestsince that would not require special drivers to be installed on the PC.Any suggestions are welcome.+---------------------------------------------------------+|  Stein Roervik   (steinr@chembio.ntnu.no)               ||                                                         ||  Research Scientist, Computer Assisted Microscopy       ||  Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Norwegian University of  ||  Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway       ||  tel. +47 73 59 39 88, fax +47 73 59 08 60              |+---------------------------------------------------------+From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Aug 11 12:57 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id MAA12988;	Tue, 11 Aug 1998 12:56:55 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Tue, 11 Aug 1998 12:56:55 -0400 (EDT)Message-ID: <19980811164333.27127.qmail@hotmail.com>X-Originating-IP: [198.14.48.122]From: "Paul Loftsgard" <ploftsgard@hotmail.com>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Fractal analysis macrosDate: Tue, 11 Aug 1998 09:43:32 PDTResent-Message-ID: <"9K4So1.0.ny2.WJ7qr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/198X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plainContent-Length:   687Status: OHello,	I've been using the fractal analysis macros to analyze super critical sprays and I have two questions.1.

All images will be created and saved inNIH image on the Mac. I want to do this on writable CD-ROMs.I have purchased a Sony Storewell CD writer. I have tested it and it workswell. The CD writer software, Adaptec Toast, can record in both Mac andWindows/Jouliet format, and the cross-platform compatible ISO format.The writer is also bundled with Adaptec DirectCD, which allows files to bemoved, renamed and deleted while the CD is "open" using the cross-platformUDF format. This functionality is very important since I often need toreorganize files as the scope of a project changes. UDF drivers areavailable for Windows as well, so I have successfully been able to readdisks written in this format on a PC.The problem is to get some way of automatically mapping file extensions tofile types. The files are of PICT, TIFF, Excel and Word types. I want someway for the PC to read the Mac file type attributes and automatically addthe proper extensions. For various reasons, it is quite impractical to addthe extensions on the Mac side. I have purchased the utility programDataWiz MacOpener for opening Mac disks on a PC. MacOpener mounts Mac disksand adds extensions automatically as desired, but only on Mac formatteddisks. If I am going to take advantage of the incremental and changeableUDF format, which is supported both by the Mac and the PC, MacOpener doesnot add the extensions as the CD is recognized by the system as a valid PCdisk.So what I need is either some utility on the PC that will recognize Macfiles as Mac files and add proper extensions, even when the disk isreadable by the PC; or some flexible (incremental) way to write CDs in ahybrid format that automatically adds extensions to the filenames in the PCdirectory part of the shared data. The latter solution is probably the bestsince that would not require special drivers to be installed on the PC.Any suggestions are welcome.+---------------------------------------------------------+|  Stein Roervik   (steinr@chembio.ntnu.no)               ||                                                         ||  Research Scientist, Computer Assisted Microscopy       ||  Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Norwegian University of  ||  Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway       ||  tel. +47 73 59 39 88, fax +47 73 59 08 60              |+---------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------Date: Tue, 11 Aug 1998 09:43:32 PDTFrom: "Paul Loftsgard" <ploftsgard@hotmail.com>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Fractal analysis macrosMessage-ID: <19980811164333.27127.qmail@hotmail.com>Content-Type: text/plainHello,	I've been using the fractal analysis macros to analyze super critical sprays and I have two questions.1.

If the contrast is good, anautoThreshold should segment your cultures from the background.  Then ananalyzeParticles should do your counts (use rMajor[] to return thediameter, or if ellipses are significant, use the average of rMinor[] andrMajor[]).  If you need help on this, let me know with a message to me offlist.Chris>Hi everyone,>>I am a new NIH Image user (v1.61 MAC), so please forgive me if you have>heard this question a million times already!

Here is thecode for two versions, one for use with saved images, and one thatworks well for live images.  Please contact me if you have questions.Laird BloomMIT Center for Cancer Research<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger><bigger>{The following is a setof instructions for the setup with our microscope; you should copy thetwo sets of macros below into separate Image files before use.  We useScion Image 1.62, essentially the same as NIH Image 1.61. You may needto modify the StartCapturing and StopCapturing commands if the "measureareas on scope" macro, depending on the source of your input.  <bold> Area measurement macros</bold>This set of macros will allow you to measure the area of a region youdraw, as described above, to get an average of all the areas youmeasure,  and to save the data in a text file and a modified version ofyour image with the areas drawn in .  The output can be imported toExcel for analysis but requires some editing to work efficiently.  Ifyou use a lot of saved images, you may want to modify the data outputfeatures of the "Area measurement macro" set to be more like that ofthe "Measure areas on scope" set.>From Scion Image "Special" menu, select "Load Macros" and open the"Area measurement macros" file in the Scion Image folder on thedesktop.  Then open your first image.Type "S" or select "Set up area measurements" in Special menu.  Thecomputer will ask you to name a file for your results.Use one of the outlining tools from the tools palette to outline theregion you want to measure.  The heart-shaped dotted line allows you todraw freehand regions with the mouse.  Then type "M" (or select"Measure area" in the Special menu), and the computer will draw a linearound what you just outlined, give the region a number, print the areain pixels in the center of the region, and enter the area in theresults file, shown at the bottom of the screen.  You can do thisrepeatedly on the same image.  The total area of the image will also begiven in the results file.When you have finished with an image, type "F" or select "Finish areameasurements" in the Special menu, and the computer will average all ofthe measurements you made, save the modified image file with a new name("[your file name] + area measurements"), and ask you which file toopen next.  (At this point, you need to save the modified images.  Justdelete them later if you don't want them.)  Click on cancel if youdon't want to measure other samples. <bold>"Measure areas on scope" macro</bold>	It is sometimes convenient to measure areas on many parts of asample without having to save each image and reopen it.  To do this andsave the areas as a set of numbers suitable for import into Excel, loadthe "Measure areas on scope" macro file.  Data are saved as a singlecolumn of numbers for each sample, which can be copied and pasted intoa single column in Excel.	To start, be sure to close the video camera window.   Then type P orpull down the "Set up measurement parameters" macro.  It will ask youwhether you want to save each image before and after labeling areas,and then it will ask you for the name of your first sample and beginshowing live video images.  When you have found the image you want,click the mouse button or press the shift, option, or control keys. (You may have to hold the key or mouse button down for a fraction of asecond or push it a second time.)  Then select a drawing tool, drawaround an area you wish to measure, and press the M key when you'reready.  The area of each region in pixels (this can be changed to mm,etc from the pulldown menus) will show up in a text file on the rightof the screen and is saved after each entry.  Be careful if you modifythis file while adding data to it (e.g., if the font is too large tolet you see all your data); if the text is still highlighted when youmeasure your next area, all of the highlighted data will be deleted(based on sad but true experience).   Keep drawing and pressing M untilyou're done with that image.  Then press V (or pull down "New view ofthis sample" macro), get your next image, and continue.  To scoreanother sample (and save the counts in a new file), press S or pulldown "Score next sample" macro.  You can open this file in Excel, orcopy and paste as a single column into a single Excel file for all ofyou data (more convenient).}{"Measure areas on scope" macro file follows:modified area measurement macro--use while measuring areas while atmicroscope.

It's designed to save data to a text file whilecollecting multiple data points per sample at the microscope.    It works well for cells labeled with DAPI, propidium iodide, oroctadecyl rhodamine--brightly fluorescent cells on a darkbackground--but is probably OK for non-fluorescent stains as well. DAPI is particularly nice because it stains only nuclei, and istherefore doesn't change much when cells spread out.  Cytoplasmic ormembrane stains (e.g. octadecyl rhodamine or FITC variants) are dimmeron spread cells than on rounded cells, and this macro sometimes hastrouble seeing dimmer spread cells labeled this way.  The macro iswritten to use only the red, green, or blue channel (gets rid ofbackground prior to threshholding), but that could be modified.  Codeis written for Scion Image 1.62.  Points at which there areScion-specific commands are noted.Please contact me if you have questions.Laird BloomMIT Center for Cancer Researchvar {Global variable, initially zero}  nAvg,Threshold:integer; {range: 10-150}procedure DoGammaTransform(gamma:real);var  i,v:integer;  n,mode,min,max:integer  mean:real;begin  measure;  GetResults(n,mean,mode,min,max);  ShowMessage('min=',min:1,'\max=',max:1);  for i:=1 to 254 DO begin    if (i>min) and (i<<max)      then v:=exp(gamma*ln((i-min)/(max-min)))*255 {x^y=exp(y*ln(x)}      else begin        if i<<=min then v:=0 else v:=255;      end;    RedLUT[i]:=255-v;    GreenLUT[i]:=255-v;    BlueLUT[i]:=255-v;  end;  UpdateLUT;end.procedure CountCells(MoreSensative:boolean);var  gamma: real;  radius: real; {peak radius; range: 1-50}  slope: real;  {peak slope (aka peakedness); range: 0.05-0.95}  BallRadius: real; {2d rolling ball radius}  i,width,height: integer;begin  SetforegroundColor(0);  SetbackgroundColor(255);  radius:=6;  slope:=0.2;  gamma:=1.6;  BallRadius:=8;  {radius:=GetNumber('Radius[1-50]:',radius);}  {slope:=GetNumber('Slope[0.05-0.95]:',slope);}  Invert;  SubtractBackground('2D Rolling Ball(faster)',BallRadius);  GetPicSize(width,height);  MakeRoi(0.05*width,0.05*height,0.9*width,0.9*height);  {EnhanceContrast;}  KillRoi;  ApplyLUT;  DoGammaTransform(gamma);  ApplyLUT;  SetOption; Smooth;  SetOption; Smooth;  if threshold=0 then begin    AutoThreshold;    wait(2);    i:=0;    Repeat      i:=i+1;    until RedLUT[i]<<255;    if MoreSensative      then Threshold:=round(0.75*i)      else Threshold:=i  end;  SetThreshold(-1);  SetLineWidth(2);  UserCode('Find Peaks', threshold, radius, slope);end;macro 'Count cells and save /1';var color,nLines,d,nDefault,nImage,j: integer; total,mean: realnOut,nSave,nNext,nWell: string;  begin   PutMessage('Clicking on cancel at any time will end the macro.',);   nOut:=GetString('Name for results file','Results');	  color:=GetNumber ('Color:  Red=1, Green=2,  Blue=3',3,0);nSave:=GetString('Save each full-size image as a 1.2 Mb file?','Yes');nDefault:=GetNumber('Default number of images per sample:',5,0);	PutMessage('To count cells from live video, click mouse button.'); 	NewTextWindow(nOut); Writeln(nOut,' ');	Writeln('Sample    			Cell counts								T=total	M=mean); Writeln; nLines:=0;  repeat              nWell:=GetString('Sample:');         nImage:=GetNumber('Number of images for thissample:',nDefault,0);        SelectWindow(nOut);        Write('Sample ',nWell,':		');	       SetUser1Label('Cell counts');        total:=0	    for j:=1 to nImage do begin{use next bracketed statement instead of theStartCapturing...StopCapturing lines if get your video image via theFile>Acquire menu.

Here is thecode for two versions, one for use with saved images, and one thatworks well for live images.  Please contact me if you have questions.Laird BloomMIT Center for Cancer Research<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger><bigger>{The following is a setof instructions for the setup with our microscope; you should copy thetwo sets of macros below into separate Image files before use.  We useScion Image 1.62, essentially the same as NIH Image 1.61. You may needto modify the StartCapturing and StopCapturing commands if the "measureareas on scope" macro, depending on the source of your input.  <bold> Area measurement macros</bold>This set of macros will allow you to measure the area of a region youdraw, as described above, to get an average of all the areas youmeasure,  and to save the data in a text file and a modified version ofyour image with the areas drawn in .  The output can be imported toExcel for analysis but requires some editing to work efficiently.  Ifyou use a lot of saved images, you may want to modify the data outputfeatures of the "Area measurement macro" set to be more like that ofthe "Measure areas on scope" set.>From Scion Image "Special" menu, select "Load Macros" and open the"Area measurement macros" file in the Scion Image folder on thedesktop.  Then open your first image.Type "S" or select "Set up area measurements" in Special menu.  Thecomputer will ask you to name a file for your results.Use one of the outlining tools from the tools palette to outline theregion you want to measure.  The heart-shaped dotted line allows you todraw freehand regions with the mouse.  Then type "M" (or select"Measure area" in the Special menu), and the computer will draw a linearound what you just outlined, give the region a number, print the areain pixels in the center of the region, and enter the area in theresults file, shown at the bottom of the screen.  You can do thisrepeatedly on the same image.  The total area of the image will also begiven in the results file.When you have finished with an image, type "F" or select "Finish areameasurements" in the Special menu, and the computer will average all ofthe measurements you made, save the modified image file with a new name("[your file name] + area measurements"), and ask you which file toopen next.  (At this point, you need to save the modified images.  Justdelete them later if you don't want them.)  Click on cancel if youdon't want to measure other samples. <bold>"Measure areas on scope" macro</bold>	It is sometimes convenient to measure areas on many parts of asample without having to save each image and reopen it.  To do this andsave the areas as a set of numbers suitable for import into Excel, loadthe "Measure areas on scope" macro file.  Data are saved as a singlecolumn of numbers for each sample, which can be copied and pasted intoa single column in Excel.	To start, be sure to close the video camera window.   Then type P orpull down the "Set up measurement parameters" macro.  It will ask youwhether you want to save each image before and after labeling areas,and then it will ask you for the name of your first sample and beginshowing live video images.  When you have found the image you want,click the mouse button or press the shift, option, or control keys. (You may have to hold the key or mouse button down for a fraction of asecond or push it a second time.)  Then select a drawing tool, drawaround an area you wish to measure, and press the M key when you'reready.  The area of each region in pixels (this can be changed to mm,etc from the pulldown menus) will show up in a text file on the rightof the screen and is saved after each entry.  Be careful if you modifythis file while adding data to it (e.g., if the font is too large tolet you see all your data); if the text is still highlighted when youmeasure your next area, all of the highlighted data will be deleted(based on sad but true experience).   Keep drawing and pressing M untilyou're done with that image.  Then press V (or pull down "New view ofthis sample" macro), get your next image, and continue.  To scoreanother sample (and save the counts in a new file), press S or pulldown "Score next sample" macro.  You can open this file in Excel, orcopy and paste as a single column into a single Excel file for all ofyou data (more convenient).}{"Measure areas on scope" macro file follows:modified area measurement macro--use while measuring areas while atmicroscope.

It's designed to save data to a text file whilecollecting multiple data points per sample at the microscope.    It works well for cells labeled with DAPI, propidium iodide, oroctadecyl rhodamine--brightly fluorescent cells on a darkbackground--but is probably OK for non-fluorescent stains as well. DAPI is particularly nice because it stains only nuclei, and istherefore doesn't change much when cells spread out.  Cytoplasmic ormembrane stains (e.g. octadecyl rhodamine or FITC variants) are dimmeron spread cells than on rounded cells, and this macro sometimes hastrouble seeing dimmer spread cells labeled this way.  The macro iswritten to use only the red, green, or blue channel (gets rid ofbackground prior to threshholding), but that could be modified.  Codeis written for Scion Image 1.62.  Points at which there areScion-specific commands are noted.Please contact me if you have questions.Laird BloomMIT Center for Cancer Researchvar {Global variable, initially zero}  nAvg,Threshold:integer; {range: 10-150}procedure DoGammaTransform(gamma:real);var  i,v:integer;  n,mode,min,max:integer  mean:real;begin  measure;  GetResults(n,mean,mode,min,max);  ShowMessage('min=',min:1,'\max=',max:1);  for i:=1 to 254 DO begin    if (i>min) and (i<<max)      then v:=exp(gamma*ln((i-min)/(max-min)))*255 {x^y=exp(y*ln(x)}      else begin        if i<<=min then v:=0 else v:=255;      end;    RedLUT[i]:=255-v;    GreenLUT[i]:=255-v;    BlueLUT[i]:=255-v;  end;  UpdateLUT;end.procedure CountCells(MoreSensative:boolean);var  gamma: real;  radius: real; {peak radius; range: 1-50}  slope: real;  {peak slope (aka peakedness); range: 0.05-0.95}  BallRadius: real; {2d rolling ball radius}  i,width,height: integer;begin  SetforegroundColor(0);  SetbackgroundColor(255);  radius:=6;  slope:=0.2;  gamma:=1.6;  BallRadius:=8;  {radius:=GetNumber('Radius[1-50]:',radius);}  {slope:=GetNumber('Slope[0.05-0.95]:',slope);}  Invert;  SubtractBackground('2D Rolling Ball(faster)',BallRadius);  GetPicSize(width,height);  MakeRoi(0.05*width,0.05*height,0.9*width,0.9*height);  {EnhanceContrast;}  KillRoi;  ApplyLUT;  DoGammaTransform(gamma);  ApplyLUT;  SetOption; Smooth;  SetOption; Smooth;  if threshold=0 then begin    AutoThreshold;    wait(2);    i:=0;    Repeat      i:=i+1;    until RedLUT[i]<<255;    if MoreSensative      then Threshold:=round(0.75*i)      else Threshold:=i  end;  SetThreshold(-1);  SetLineWidth(2);  UserCode('Find Peaks', threshold, radius, slope);end;macro 'Count cells and save /1';var color,nLines,d,nDefault,nImage,j: integer; total,mean: realnOut,nSave,nNext,nWell: string;  begin   PutMessage('Clicking on cancel at any time will end the macro.',);   nOut:=GetString('Name for results file','Results');	  color:=GetNumber ('Color:  Red=1, Green=2,  Blue=3',3,0);nSave:=GetString('Save each full-size image as a 1.2 Mb file?','Yes');nDefault:=GetNumber('Default number of images per sample:',5,0);	PutMessage('To count cells from live video, click mouse button.'); 	NewTextWindow(nOut); Writeln(nOut,' ');	Writeln('Sample    			Cell counts								T=total	M=mean); Writeln; nLines:=0;  repeat              nWell:=GetString('Sample:');         nImage:=GetNumber('Number of images for thissample:',nDefault,0);        SelectWindow(nOut);        Write('Sample ',nWell,':		');	       SetUser1Label('Cell counts');        total:=0	    for j:=1 to nImage do begin{use next bracketed statement instead of theStartCapturing...StopCapturing lines if get your video image via theFile>Acquire menu.

Thesystem utilizes the old LG-3/TV-3 combination as an old IIci that waslaying around is being used solely for this imaging system.  I tested thecards and Cohu camera out on a PowerMac 7100.  Utilizing NIH Image, I gotgreat, crisp pictures.  I was using version 1.62a of NIH Image.I then went to install on the Mac IIci.  I was using version 1.55 of NIHImage, since 1.62a needs a PowerMac.  Upon attempting to capture an image Iget a highly grainy and image that has quite a bit of snow.  Obviously notcrisp at all.  The gain on the camera is 0, and all of the other settingsare as they should be according to Cohu and Scion.  I remember some things a while ago concerning the FPU and non-FPU versionsof Image.

The gain on the camera is 0, and all of the other settingsare as they should be according to Cohu and Scion.  I remember some things a while ago concerning the FPU and non-FPU versionsof Image.

The program states that "Erode and Dilate do not perform erosion and dilation with structuring elements as described in the literature of classical mathematical morphology."  I'm trying to understand what I am doing when I use the Binary submenu.  The program defines these  procedures:Erode - Removes pixels from the edges of objects in a binary images, where contiguous black areas in the image are considered objects, and background is assumed to be white. A pixel is removed (set to white) if four or more of its eight neighbors are white. Erosion separates objects that are touching and removes isolated pixels.Dilate - Adds pixels to the edges of objects in a binary images. A pixel is added (set to black) if four or more of its eight neighbors are black. Dilation connects discontinuous objects and fills in holes. Does Image do morphologic operations?  Is if fair to say a morphologic operation is the net change to an image, regardless of the technique used to get there?  In other words, does it matter if I skeletonize an image with Image or, say, Alice [Dip Station] which apparently uses different mathematical structuring elements?  If they are different, can I use the morphologic operator literature to justify a technique I develop using Image?I'd appreciate any input I can get!Mike ShroutAssociate ProfessorMedical College of GeorgiaFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Wed Aug 19 09:50 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id JAA03097;	Wed, 19 Aug 1998 09:49:56 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Wed, 19 Aug 1998 09:49:56 -0400 (EDT)Message-ID: <35DAE297.5C5F372@netmatters.co.uk>Date: Wed, 19 Aug 1998 14:35:10 +0000From: Jeremy Brown <brownj@netmatters.co.uk>Reply-To: brownj@netmatters.co.ukOrganization: brownj@netmatters.co.ukX-Mailer: Mozilla 4.04 (Macintosh; I; PPC)MIME-Version: 1.0To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: EDINBURGH LOCAL FORUM?References: <s5da858a.047@mail.mcg.edu>Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitResent-Message-ID: <"GgD3X1.0.fO.1Ijsr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/227X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; x-mac-type="54455854"; x-mac-creator="4D4F5353"Content-Length:   314Status: OWould anyone in the Edinburgh Area, or Scotland come to that, be interested in some kind of local NIH/Object/Scion Image forum?Jeremy***********************************************Jeremy BrownMoredun Research Institute / The University Of Edinburghhttp://users.netmatters.co.uk/brownj/ICHomePage.htmlFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Wed Aug 19 11:52 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id LAA12778;	Wed, 19 Aug 1998 11:52:37 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Wed, 19 Aug 1998 11:52:37 -0400 (EDT)Date: Wed, 19 Aug 1998 11:33:06 -0400Message-Id: <v01540b00b20064cba8a4@[206.152.160.60]>Mime-Version: 1.0To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu (Drexel Computer Vision Center)From: hmthomas@med.cornell.edu (Henry M.

The program states that "Erode and Dilate do not perform erosion and dilation with structuring elements as described in the literature of classical mathematical morphology."  I'm trying to understand what I am doing when I use the Binary submenu.  The program defines these  procedures:Erode - Removes pixels from the edges of objects in a binary images, where contiguous black areas in the image are considered objects, and background is assumed to be white. A pixel is removed (set to white) if four or more of its eight neighbors are white. Erosion separates objects that are touching and removes isolated pixels.Dilate - Adds pixels to the edges of objects in a binary images. A pixel is added (set to black) if four or more of its eight neighbors are black. Dilation connects discontinuous objects and fills in holes. Does Image do morphologic operations?  Is if fair to say a morphologic operation is the net change to an image, regardless of the technique used to get there?  In other words, does it matter if I skeletonize an image with Image or, say, Alice [Dip Station] which apparently uses different mathematical structuring elements?  If they are different, can I use the morphologic operator literature to justify a technique I develop using Image?I'd appreciate any input I can get!Mike ShroutAssociate ProfessorMedical College of Georgia------------------------------Date: Wed, 19 Aug 1998 14:35:10 +0000From: Jeremy Brown <brownj@netmatters.co.uk>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: EDINBURGH LOCAL FORUM?Message-ID: <35DAE297.5C5F372@netmatters.co.uk>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; x-mac-type="54455854"; x-mac-creator="4D4F5353"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitWould anyone in the Edinburgh Area, or Scotland come to that, be interested in some kind of local NIH/Object/Scion Image forum?Jeremy***********************************************Jeremy BrownMoredun Research Institute / The University Of Edinburghhttp://users.netmatters.co.uk/brownj/ICHomePage.html------------------------------Date: Wed, 19 Aug 1998 11:33:06 -0400From: hmthomas@med.cornell.edu (Henry M.

Moreover, DIP Station allows you todefine your own structuring elements.Anyway, if you try DIP Station morphology with binary images, you shouldget the same results of NIH-Image morphology, as far as the structuringelements are the same. For instance, NIH-Image structuring element with 4 neighbours should be	 *	***	 *and with 8 neighbours	***	***	***Be careful because DIP Station allows you to define also the centre ofthe structuring element, that does change the result. Also check blacksand whites because NIH-Image erosion may be DIP Station dilation andvice-versa.If you have more questions, I'll be at work tomorrow (Friday) and thenafter September 15th.Hope this helps.David**********************************************************David Zuccala'ENEL RICERCA - Polo Idraulico e Strutturale              v.

I am currently using NIH-image to determine eggnumbers from samples taken from female broodstock tiger prawns afterspawning. =20Firstly, I should give you some background information of how I am usingthis program.  At AIMS (The Australian Institute of Marine Science)Mariculture facility an average experiment can involve anything up to 100female broodstock.  When a female spawns we subsample her eggs (fivereplicates per sample) to detemine fecundity.  Currently these samplesare manually counted and if each female spawns twice (although she canspawn up to five times during an experiment) that's a minimum  of 400samples (of which each replicate can contain up to 300 individual eggs)that need to be counted.  That's a lot of counting, labour and time.  Ihave just started to use NIH-image and I am still learning about it'slimits and functions with the help of your manual and general use of theprogram. =20I have several problems which I have encountered.  The prawn eggs arebetween 100-150<italic>um</italic> in size and I can clearly see the eggson the computer monitor.  Unfortunately when the egg samples arecollected they are fixed in alcohol and this sometimes produces aprecipitate and other floculative material which ranges in size andshape. =20<bold>1)</bold> Is their a way that I can tell the computer to look for<underline>spherical</underline> eggs within a given pixel range?  At themoment when I define a given pixel size/range the computer detects otherparticles within this range which are not eggs.  The eggs are alwaysspherical and do not resemble any other floculative material.<bold>2)</bold> Another problem is that sometimes the eggs clump and arenot detected because they are larger than the defined pixel range.  I amcurrently testing different detergents which have only partially resolvedthe problem.  My question is, is their some way of telling the program tomeasure the area (in the field of view) which is shaded by the eggs andgiven the size of the eggs accuratley working out the number of eggswhich correlate to the shaded area within the given field of view?  Forexample, If a their is a clump of eggs the program measures the area theyoccupy and knowing that one egg is so many pixels in size determines thattheir is 4 eggs within that clump.  Are these solvable problems or am Ihoping for too much out of this program?  If this can be done, is theiralso a way of getting the program to differentiate between an egg andother particles?  Can you tell the program to take a picture of an eggand only count paricles which conform to it's size and shape?  The eggsare quite distinct, spherical and can be seen easily with the naked=20eye.I know that some of these questions may be too complex but I hope thatyou can shed some light as this program would be a huge benefit if I canimplement an accurate automated process for counting egg samples.

It is easier to count analyse image of separate eggs than to separate eggs in the image :-) but there is a balance in that you want to maintain a reasonable egg density / field size / resolution.Assuming you are using a PAL video camera 768x512 pixels and 100um eggs are say minimum 16 pixel diameter to allow adequate circularity test, you might expect eggs at say 32 pixel centers 24x16=384 eggs per field (5x3 mm) ....matches 300 per sample quite well.A ring-light illuminator to give you a dark field background with low angle incident light scatter from eggs to a dissecting microscope should give good contrast.The tack I would take would be to analyzeParticles for eggsize particle range and then do a macro pass of each egg rMajor/rMinor axis to check near 1 and rMax[]~=rMin[] for uniform color.More stringent qualification of particles could be done using autoOutline(rX[i],rY[i]) ie automated "wand"ing of each "particle" to allow detail analysis of shape.You would then have data for a size histogram.Larger "particles" or clumps could then be estimated on the basis ofrArea[clump]/modal rArea[egg]A circular Hough transform could be used to emphasise circular objects (in clumps) but I would expect this to be an unnecessary complication in your case.Greg Joss,School of Biological Sciences, Phone:(61)(2) 9850 8212 Fax: 9850 8174Macquarie University,          Email gjoss@rna.bio.mq.edu.auNorth Ryde, (Sydney,) NSW 2109, AustraliaFrom nih-image-d-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Thu Aug 20 23:21 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id XAA26301;	Thu, 20 Aug 1998 23:21:46 -0400 (EDT)Date: Thu, 20 Aug 1998 23:21:46 -0400 (EDT)From: nih-image-d-request@io.ece.drexel.eduMessage-Id: <199808210321.XAA26301@io.ECE.Drexel.EDU>Subject: nih-image-d Digest V98 #41X-Loop: nih-image-d@biomed.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image-d@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/volume98/41Precedence: listMIME-Version: 1.0To: nih-image-d@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: multipart/digest; boundary="----------------------------"Content-Length:  9957Status: O------------------------------Content-Type: text/plainnih-image-d Digest				Volume 98 : Issue 41Today's Topics:  Re: Morphologic Operations and NIH I  [ "Zuccala David" <zuccala@cris.enel. ]  Re: NIH Quicktimes in PowerPoint Pre  [ Cengizhan Ozturk <cozturk@mri.jhu.e ]  Questions on NIH-image                [ Matt Salmon <m.salmon@aims.gov.au> ]  Re: Questions on NIH-image            [ GJOSS@rna.bio.mq.edu.au ]------------------------------Date: Thu, 20 Aug 1998 12:41:08 -0700From: "Zuccala David" <zuccala@cris.enel.it>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: Re: Morphologic Operations and NIH ImageMessage-ID: <35DC7BD4.3B92@cris.enel.it>Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-asciiContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit>  Does Image do morphologic operations?

Moreover, DIP Station allows you todefine your own structuring elements.Anyway, if you try DIP Station morphology with binary images, you shouldget the same results of NIH-Image morphology, as far as the structuringelements are the same. For instance, NIH-Image structuring element with 4 neighbours should be	 *	***	 *and with 8 neighbours	***	***	***Be careful because DIP Station allows you to define also the centre ofthe structuring element, that does change the result. Also check blacksand whites because NIH-Image erosion may be DIP Station dilation andvice-versa.If you have more questions, I'll be at work tomorrow (Friday) and thenafter September 15th.Hope this helps.David**********************************************************David Zuccala'ENEL RICERCA - Polo Idraulico e Strutturale              v.

I am currently using NIH-image to determine eggnumbers from samples taken from female broodstock tiger prawns afterspawning. =20Firstly, I should give you some background information of how I am usingthis program.  At AIMS (The Australian Institute of Marine Science)Mariculture facility an average experiment can involve anything up to 100female broodstock.  When a female spawns we subsample her eggs (fivereplicates per sample) to detemine fecundity.  Currently these samplesare manually counted and if each female spawns twice (although she canspawn up to five times during an experiment) that's a minimum  of 400samples (of which each replicate can contain up to 300 individual eggs)that need to be counted.  That's a lot of counting, labour and time.  Ihave just started to use NIH-image and I am still learning about it'slimits and functions with the help of your manual and general use of theprogram. =20I have several problems which I have encountered.  The prawn eggs arebetween 100-150<italic>um</italic> in size and I can clearly see the eggson the computer monitor.  Unfortunately when the egg samples arecollected they are fixed in alcohol and this sometimes produces aprecipitate and other floculative material which ranges in size andshape. =20<bold>1)</bold> Is their a way that I can tell the computer to look for<underline>spherical</underline> eggs within a given pixel range?  At themoment when I define a given pixel size/range the computer detects otherparticles within this range which are not eggs.  The eggs are alwaysspherical and do not resemble any other floculative material.<bold>2)</bold> Another problem is that sometimes the eggs clump and arenot detected because they are larger than the defined pixel range.  I amcurrently testing different detergents which have only partially resolvedthe problem.  My question is, is their some way of telling the program tomeasure the area (in the field of view) which is shaded by the eggs andgiven the size of the eggs accuratley working out the number of eggswhich correlate to the shaded area within the given field of view?  Forexample, If a their is a clump of eggs the program measures the area theyoccupy and knowing that one egg is so many pixels in size determines thattheir is 4 eggs within that clump.  Are these solvable problems or am Ihoping for too much out of this program?  If this can be done, is theiralso a way of getting the program to differentiate between an egg andother particles?  Can you tell the program to take a picture of an eggand only count paricles which conform to it's size and shape?  The eggsare quite distinct, spherical and can be seen easily with the naked=20eye.I know that some of these questions may be too complex but I hope thatyou can shed some light as this program would be a huge benefit if I canimplement an accurate automated process for counting egg samples.  I'msure you will be hearing from me regularly but I hope I don't become tomuch of a nuisance.Yours Sincerely,Matt Salmon BSc.------------------------------Date:          Fri, 21 Aug 1998 13:13:36 GMT+1000From: GJOSS@rna.bio.mq.edu.auTo: m.salmon@aims.gov.au, nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject:       Re: Questions on NIH-imageMessage-ID: <6583BB8361F@rna.bio.mq.edu.au>>Date: Fri, 21 Aug 1998 11:44:39 +1000>From: Matt Salmon <m.salmon@aims.gov.au>>Subject: Questions on NIH-image>............

Image analysis is better if your samples are perfect. But you knowthat already.2. The eggs are little spheres but what you see on the monitor iscircles.3. Is there some filtering you might do to pick out circles of a certainsize range?I have some suggestions.1 Try some FFT filterings using low or high pass filters.2. Take an image of 1 egg all by itself and FFT this and then use thisas a mask for an image of many eggs. This is based on the idea that isseen in John Russ's book The Image Processing handbook, in which a pageof text is processed using a template or mask made from one letter, inthe case illustrated an "e" I think. If you use a mask which passes thefrequency you should pick out all the 'e''s whereas if you filter outthe frequencies associated with the 'e''s you should remove them.3. Try some convolution filters.Variables to try. Filter size can vary from 3x3 up to 63x63.Values in each of the filter cells can be between 0-255. Try with scaled convolutions on and off.To try all of the possibilities can take quite a while.ie with a 3x3 filter there are 9x256 arrangements, some of which wouldbe symmetrically equivalent.Why it might be good.With a suitable convolution mask which is circular (use zeros to pad itout to the square) and of the same size as the circles in question thena useful effect might be had.4.Try some background subtractions which can be used to remove small bitsfrom the field.5. Try the ideas of masking the image with a thresholded image etc.6. I guess the eggs are the same density grey as the other materials, ifnot thresholding might help.7. If you know the size of one egg and then write a macro it could beused to determine the number of eggs in a mass of nicely packed eggs.You would of course need to calibrate by counting a few hundred anddividing by the appropriate number. Best regardsNoel> ----------> From: 	Matt Salmon> Sent: 	Friday, 21 August 1998 11:44 AM> To: 	nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu> Subject: 	Questions on NIH-image> > Hi, I have just subscribed to your mailing list so I hope that this> message gets through.

Fractal dimension varies greatly with size, because of thelimited amount of data generated with that method. That is the primaryreason why I never use this method on boundaries. The scale of the study istoo limited to use it.With EDM, I manage to produce consistant fractal dimensions (variations of0.03 max) for particle sizes between 10000 and 400000 pixels. This wastested on a few particles, by varying the resolution  of the image (at thetime of the acquisition, of course!).>>I am finding the dimensions of sprays and at the top and bottom of each>spray is a flat side(the end of the cameras field of view).

If your image could be limited tojust your two side lines (not the straignt ones), I don't see the problemwith the fractal analysis. You could crop your image to eliminate the twoflat sizes (if they are at the top and bottom of the image). Fractalanalysis would then be limited to the two lines still on the picture.

Image analysis is better if your samples are perfect. But you knowthat already.2. The eggs are little spheres but what you see on the monitor iscircles.3. Is there some filtering you might do to pick out circles of a certainsize range?I have some suggestions.1 Try some FFT filterings using low or high pass filters.2. Take an image of 1 egg all by itself and FFT this and then use thisas a mask for an image of many eggs. This is based on the idea that isseen in John Russ's book The Image Processing handbook, in which a pageof text is processed using a template or mask made from one letter, inthe case illustrated an "e" I think. If you use a mask which passes thefrequency you should pick out all the 'e''s whereas if you filter outthe frequencies associated with the 'e''s you should remove them.3. Try some convolution filters.Variables to try. Filter size can vary from 3x3 up to 63x63.Values in each of the filter cells can be between 0-255. Try with scaled convolutions on and off.To try all of the possibilities can take quite a while.ie with a 3x3 filter there are 9x256 arrangements, some of which wouldbe symmetrically equivalent.Why it might be good.With a suitable convolution mask which is circular (use zeros to pad itout to the square) and of the same size as the circles in question thena useful effect might be had.4.Try some background subtractions which can be used to remove small bitsfrom the field.5. Try the ideas of masking the image with a thresholded image etc.6. I guess the eggs are the same density grey as the other materials, ifnot thresholding might help.7. If you know the size of one egg and then write a macro it could beused to determine the number of eggs in a mass of nicely packed eggs.You would of course need to calibrate by counting a few hundred anddividing by the appropriate number. Best regardsNoel> ----------> From: 	Matt Salmon> Sent: 	Friday, 21 August 1998 11:44 AM> To: 	nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu> Subject: 	Questions on NIH-image> > Hi, I have just subscribed to your mailing list so I hope that this> message gets through.  I am currently using NIH-image to determine egg> numbers from samples taken from female broodstock tiger prawns after> spawning.   > Firstly, I should give you some background information of how I am> using this program.  At AIMS (The Australian Institute of Marine> Science) Mariculture facility an average experiment can involve> anything up to 100 female broodstock.  When a female spawns we> subsample her eggs (five replicates per sample) to detemine fecundity.> Currently these samples are manually counted and if each female spawns> twice (although she can spawn up to five times during an experiment)> that's a minimum  of 400 samples (of which each replicate can contain> up to 300 individual eggs) that need to be counted.  That's a lot of> counting, labour and time.  I have just started to use NIH-image and I> am still learning about it's limits and functions with the help of> your manual and general use of the program.   > I have several problems which I have encountered.  The prawn eggs are> between 100-150um in size and I can clearly see the eggs on the> computer monitor.  Unfortunately when the egg samples are collected> they are fixed in alcohol and this sometimes produces a precipitate> and other floculative material which ranges in size and shape.   > 1) Is their a way that I can tell the computer to look for spherical> eggs within a given pixel range?  At the moment when I define a given> pixel size/range the computer detects other particles within this> range which are not eggs.  The eggs are always spherical and do not> resemble any other floculative material. > 2) Another problem is that sometimes the eggs clump and are not> detected because they are larger than the defined pixel range.  I am> currently testing different detergents which have only partially> resolved the problem.  My question is, is their some way of telling> the program to measure the area (in the field of view) which is shaded> by the eggs and given the size of the eggs accuratley working out the> number of eggs which correlate to the shaded area within the given> field of view?

If this can be done, is their also a way of getting the> program to differentiate between an egg and other particles?  Can you> tell the program to take a picture of an egg and only count paricles> which conform to it's size and shape?  The eggs are quite distinct,> spherical and can be seen easily with the naked  eye. > I know that some of these questions may be too complex but I hope that> you can shed some light as this program would be a huge benefit if I> can implement an accurate automated process for counting egg samples.> I'm sure you will be hearing from me regularly but I hope I don't> become to much of a nuisance. > > Yours Sincerely, > > Matt Salmon BSc. > ------------------------------Date: Fri, 21 Aug 1998 13:02:30 PDTFrom: "Paul Loftsgard" <ploftsgard@hotmail.com>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject: fractal analysisMessage-ID: <19980821200230.19206.qmail@hotmail.com>Content-Type: text/plainI have another question about the fractal analysis macros(I wrote a couple weeks ago about edm).

Anyway my question is this:>>Does area play a factor in determing fractal dimension with either the>box counting or edm method?My own experience showed that size is of the most importance withbox-counting. Fractal dimension varies greatly with size, because of thelimited amount of data generated with that method. That is the primaryreason why I never use this method on boundaries. The scale of the study istoo limited to use it.With EDM, I manage to produce consistant fractal dimensions (variations of0.03 max) for particle sizes between 10000 and 400000 pixels. This wastested on a few particles, by varying the resolution  of the image (at thetime of the acquisition, of course!).>>I am finding the dimensions of sprays and at the top and bottom of each>spray is a flat side(the end of the cameras field of view).

The highest resolution?>The consumer model digital cameras have a fixed lens and so cannot beattached to a scope. Higher end professional systems consists of digitalbacks on SLR bodies and so, I believe could be readily mounted-you'll wantan extension tube (Kodak makes models with Canon and Nikon bodies). Thelatter also provide manual overrides and better light meters. If you arenot limited by low light intensity these provide a good system. They startat the $4k or so  (Minolta RD-175) and go up to the stratosphere (20k forDCS 460-a beauty with 3kx2k pixels). On the Minolta you get a 3-chip systemwith the resolution achieved in part by software interpolation. Anotheroption that is a relatively inexpensive solution, 6k, is the Leaf linecamera which gives very high real resolution color images but with slowacquisition time. All these systems do not require a framegrabber. Thespatial resolution you need obviously depends on application. Anotherconcern to keep in mind is densitometric accuracy. If you are intending onperforming densitometric measurements or segmentation, then consumer levelsystems are unlikely to be sufficiently accurate.  The professional systemsI suspect would do fine.A low cost monochrome solution is the Sony XC77. For 1k you get an accurateCCD camera albiet a low resolution one. Other systems exist that use thesame chip and give you more electronic control. Color low cost system suchas Cohu's cameras exist though have disappointing color matching-notsuitable for publication.>From the DV camcorder market, spatial resolution is a major issue-its low,light sensitivity is often exasperatingly poor, and again mounting is aproblem. Canon has a new system, the XL1.  I would love to hear anyone'sexperience with this system. Its under 5k, 3 chip with interchangeablelenses. Its a NTSC system-so don't expect much resolution wise.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Jonathan Nissanov, Ph.D.                                      Associate Director            Computer Vision Center for Vertebrate Brain Mapping,                a NIH Biomedical Research Technology Resource                                http://cbis.ece.drexel.edu/ICVC/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Imaging and Computer Vision Center              Tel: 215-895-1381Drexel University                                                   Fax:215-895-4987Phildelphia, PA 19104yoni@coe.drexel.edu -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     And remember, the early bird may get the worm, but the second mousegets the cheese.From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Wed Aug 26 17:02 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id RAA06730;	Wed, 26 Aug 1998 17:02:19 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Wed, 26 Aug 1998 17:02:19 -0400 (EDT)Message-ID: <c=US%a=_%p=Indiana_Universi%l=PYRITE-980826204709Z-6704@pyrite.igs.indiana.edu>From: "Barwood, Henry" <hbarwood@pyrite.igs.indiana.edu>To: "'nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu'" <nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu>Subject: RE: Q: Video or digital camera?Date: Wed, 26 Aug 1998 15:47:09 -0500X-Mailer:  Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Connector Version 4.0.994.63Encoding: 8 TEXTResent-Message-ID: <"3_RXw3.0.TI1.vE7vr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/252X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: textContent-Length: 256Does anyone know if the new camcorders with "0" lux (infrared)capability are offered in a package with "C" mount lenses?

However, the trade off is that you only get 640 x480 pixels (slightly more if you use a PAL camera instead of NTSC). Also, there are video cameras in a wide range of prices, andfunctionalities.

Does anybody have experience with using both>digital cameras and video cameras and could comment on which method gives>the best image quality? The highest resolution?>The consumer model digital cameras have a fixed lens and so cannot beattached to a scope. Higher end professional systems consists of digitalbacks on SLR bodies and so, I believe could be readily mounted-you'll wantan extension tube (Kodak makes models with Canon and Nikon bodies). Thelatter also provide manual overrides and better light meters. If you arenot limited by low light intensity these provide a good system. They startat the $4k or so  (Minolta RD-175) and go up to the stratosphere (20k forDCS 460-a beauty with 3kx2k pixels). On the Minolta you get a 3-chip systemwith the resolution achieved in part by software interpolation. Anotheroption that is a relatively inexpensive solution, 6k, is the Leaf linecamera which gives very high real resolution color images but with slowacquisition time. All these systems do not require a framegrabber. Thespatial resolution you need obviously depends on application. Anotherconcern to keep in mind is densitometric accuracy. If you are intending onperforming densitometric measurements or segmentation, then consumer levelsystems are unlikely to be sufficiently accurate.  The professional systemsI suspect would do fine.A low cost monochrome solution is the Sony XC77. For 1k you get an accurateCCD camera albiet a low resolution one. Other systems exist that use thesame chip and give you more electronic control. Color low cost system suchas Cohu's cameras exist though have disappointing color matching-notsuitable for publication.>From the DV camcorder market, spatial resolution is a major issue-its low,light sensitivity is often exasperatingly poor, and again mounting is aproblem. Canon has a new system, the XL1.  I would love to hear anyone'sexperience with this system. Its under 5k, 3 chip with interchangeablelenses. Its a NTSC system-so don't expect much resolution wise.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Jonathan Nissanov, Ph.D.                                      Associate Director            Computer Vision Center for Vertebrate Brain Mapping,                a NIH Biomedical Research Technology Resource                                http://cbis.ece.drexel.edu/ICVC/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Imaging and Computer Vision Center              Tel: 215-895-1381Drexel University                                                   Fax:215-895-4987Phildelphia, PA 19104yoni@coe.drexel.edu -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     And remember, the early bird may get the worm, but the second mousegets the cheese.------------------------------Date: Wed, 26 Aug 1998 15:47:09 -0500From: "Barwood, Henry" <hbarwood@pyrite.igs.indiana.edu>To: "'nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu'" <nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu>Subject: RE: Q: Video or digital camera?Message-ID: <c=US%a=_%p=Indiana_Universi%l=PYRITE-980826204709Z-6704@pyrite.igs.indiana.edu>Does anyone know if the new camcorders with "0" lux (infrared)capability are offered in a package with "C" mount lenses?

However, the trade off is that you only get 640 x480 pixels (slightly more if you use a PAL camera instead of NTSC). Also, there are video cameras in a wide range of prices, andfunctionalities.  Video cameras range from monochrome to single andthree chip color cameras.  And some have the ability to do on-chipintegration for detecting very weak signals.  You also have the optionof getting most cameras in cooled or uncooled versions.As for digital cameras, I am only familiar with the high end scientificcameras such as the Photometrics Sensys, and the Diagnostic InstrumentsSpot.  These cameras are nice in that they provide a much higherresolution image (1kx1k or better) that maps 1 image pixel to one ccdpixel.  However, they are SLOW (3 fps at full resolution, faster withbinning, or lower resolution, but I don't think they ever get upto videorates), and they are only monochrome.  There is a solution for capturingcolor images with the Sensys that uses an LCD filter to filter the imagefor RGB and capture 3 images that are then merged to form the colorimage, but that takes even longer, and usually requires some fiddling toget the capture times right so that the colors come out right.  Finally,the biggest disadvantage for you is that they run in the $15k+ range.Unless your project truely requires the high resolution of a digitalcamera, a video camera will be cheaper and easier to setup and use.Chris TullyImage Processing ConsultantS&M MicroscopesColorado Springs, COJan Kreft wrote:> > Dear all,> > we intend to buy some hardware to capture images from a phase contrast> microscope.

Essentially, I write themacro in a way that expects there to be an open image file at thestart, and then after doing the measurement procedures, closes or savesthe current image and opens the next one.  I also set up the macro so Ican start it with a single keystroke (using [x] in the macro title,where x is a single key).  That way it's fairly straightforward to drawyour ROI and press a key, then have the computer do measurements andopen your next slice for you.  	I often do this in conjunction with two other macros, one to setinitial parameters (type of measurements, name of file for savingresults, etc.) and open the first image, the other to analyze the datain the results file after the individual images have been measured. Below is an example we use for capturing live video images andmeasuring the areas of a number of freehand ROIs from each of a numberof images, then saving each area in a file.  In this case, the "MeasureArea[M]" macro is used multiple times for multiple ROIs in a singleimage, and then the<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger><bigger>'New view of current sample [v]'</bigger></bigger></fontfamily> macrogets rid of the current image and has the computer acquire a new one,using the GetImageToMeasure procedure.  Like the old VW ads:  it'sugly, but it gets you there.Good luck.Laird BloomMIT Center for Cancer Research<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger><bigger>{  We use Scion Image1.62, essentially the same as NIH Image 1.61. You may need to modifythe StartCapturing and StopCapturing commands if the "measure areas onscope" macro, depending on the source of your input.  Excerpt from labprotocol book precedes the macro code.<bold>"Measure areas on scope" macro</bold>	It is sometimes convenient to measure areas on many parts of asample without having to save each image and reopen it.  To do this andsave the areas as a set of numbers suitable for import into Excel, loadthe "Measure areas on scope" macro file.  Data are saved as a singlecolumn of numbers for each sample, which can be copied and pasted intoa single column in Excel.	To start, be sure to close the video camera window.   Then type P orpull down the "Set up measurement parameters" macro.  It will ask youwhether you want to save each image before and after labeling areas,and then it will ask you for the name of your first sample and beginshowing live video images.  When you have found the image you want,click the mouse button or press the shift, option, or control keys. (You may have to hold the key or mouse button down for a fraction of asecond or push it a second time.)  Then select a drawing tool, drawaround an area you wish to measure, and press the M key when you'reready.  The area of each region in pixels (this can be changed to mm,etc from the pulldown menus) will show up in a text file on the rightof the screen and is saved after each entry.  Be careful if you modifythis file while adding data to it (e.g., if the font is too large tolet you see all your data); if the text is still highlighted when youmeasure your next area, all of the highlighted data will be deleted(based on sad but true experience).   Keep drawing and pressing M untilyou're done with that image.  Then press V (or pull down "New view ofthis sample" macro), get your next image, and continue.  To scoreanother sample (and save the counts in a new file), press S or pulldown "Score next sample" macro.  You can open this file in Excel, orcopy and paste as a single column into a single Excel file for all ofyou data (more convenient).}{"Measure areas on scope" macro file follows:modified area measurement macro--use while measuring areas while atmicroscope.  Saves data for each sample in a separate file as a columnof numbers; import into Excel for analysis.}var {Global variables} n,d,nLines,j,total,TotalArea:integer; 	mean:real;SaveMod,nSave,nSample,SampleName,ImageName:string;procedure GetImageToMeasure;beginStartCapturing;	Repeat		Wait(.1);	Until Button or KeyDown('shift') or KeyDown('option') orKeyDown('control');StopCapturing;SetPicName(nSample,'  Image');SelectWindow(nSample,'  Image');         if nSave='Yes'              then Save;endprocedure LabelAreaInCenter;var  left, top, width, height, x, y: integer;  scale: real;  unit: string;begin  GetRoi(left,top,width,height);  if width=0 then begin    PutMessage('This macro requires a selection.');    exit;  end;  SaveState;  InvertY(false);  SetForegroundColor(255); {black}SetBackgroundColor(1);  SetOptions('Area; Mean; X-Y Center');  GetScale(scale, unit);  Measure;	DrawBoundary;x := round(rX[rCount] * scale);  y := round(rY[rCount] * scale);  MoveTo(x-5, y);	SetFont('Times');	SetFontSize(9);SetText('With Background');	Writeln('region ',j:0);  Write(rArea[rCount]:1:0);  RestoreState;end;macro 'Measure Area [M]';begin	j:=j+1;	LabelAreaInCenter;	ImageName:=WindowTitle;	SelectWindow(nSample);        	If j=1		then writeln (nSample); 		SetFont('Times');		SetFontSize(12);         Writeln('    ',rArea[rCount]:1:0); 		rUser1[j]:=rArea[rCount];		total:=total+rArea[rCount];      Save;	SelectWindow(ImageName);endmacro 'Set parameters for area measurements [P]';var	width,height:integer;begin	nSave:=GetString('Save each image as a 1.2 MB file?','Yes');	SaveMod:=GetString('Save each image with areas marked?','Yes');	nSample:=GetString('name of first sample');{Places data window at far right side of screen.

Do Ihave to write a user interface so that they can signify what measurementsto use (ie. they make a mistake and measure the perimeter again) and tosignal when each slide is finished?  All the macros I've seen don't appearto do this.  If you can give me any insight, I'd appreciate it.  And ofcourse, we need this asap.

I looked on the Image home page and foundthere was a version 1.62b20 for Code Warrior Pro 2. I recently bought CodeWarrior Pro 3 which I installed on a Windows 95 machine. I was wondering ifthere was any version of the Image source code that would compile usingCode Warrior Pro 3 (or if there isn't one now if there might be one in thenear future). In addition, since Code Warrior Pro 3 allows you to compileprojects for multiple targets, will it ever be possible to obtain sourcecode that I could use with Code Warrior Pro 3 to compile a version of Imageto run on a Windows machine?  Sorry for being greedy, but a version of thesource code that would allow me to compile an extended version of Image fora Windows machine would be of great value to me (and I assume to others aswell). Bill Boskingbillb@neuro.duke.edu919-684-8510 phone919-684-4431 FAXFrom nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Sep  1 00:30 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id AAA13619;	Tue, 1 Sep 1998 00:30:06 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Tue, 1 Sep 1998 00:30:06 -0400 (EDT)From: GJOSS@rna.bio.mq.edu.auOrganization:  School of Biological SciencesTo: goldst@mail.biu.ac.il, nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduDate:          Tue, 1 Sep 1998 14:23:13 GMT+1000Subject:       Re: integration of dim fluorescent signalsPriority: normalX-mailer: Pegasus Mail/Mac (v2.2.1)Message-ID: <761767A26AC@rna.bio.mq.edu.au>Resent-Message-ID: <"ZnGVR.0.453.gOtwr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/271X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: textContent-Length: 3542>Date: Mon, 31 Aug 1998 15:38:38 +0300>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu>From: "Dr. Ron Goldstein" <goldst@mail.biu.ac.il>>Subject: integration of dim fluorescent signals>>I have been having trouble figuring out how to use the integration function>of the Averaging menu in Image.

These give the range of the actual (integrated) sum of pixel values as stored in the intermediate temporary real image which would then be scaled to set max=254, min=1 (not 255,0).Using "Fix Scale" your own offset and scale values are used.For n=8, the maximum accumulated pixel value would be 256n = 2048so "Fix Scale",0,1024 would achieve your requested result.In practice you would probably find a non-zero minimum (which you can read off the Info window. (Re)Entry of the values min,min+1024 would then result in better contrast.Better still, inspect the histogram of the captured integrated image to see where the "real" max/min are ie the range of interest excluding backround, outliers or highlights. It is then practical (if not always straight forward) to set min/max values to maximising useful contrast in converting from the internal real value image to the 8 bit result.You can test this at the macro level by imageing print on paper ("black" on "white") with integration checked. With video controls gain/offset set correctly (or regardless) and "Fix Scale" not checked, the histogram should range 1-254 (0,255 vacant). ShowHistogram should then enable you to see the histogram pixel range which corresponds to the "white" paper.Select a ROI which excludes text (ie white paper only) and capture again. The Info window will report the min/max of the integrated ROI ie paper only.Feeding these values back into a "Fix Scale" integration will give you a high contrast image of the "white" paper (with the print saturated black and effectively ignored in this contrast range).Greg Joss,School of Biological Sciences, Phone:(61)(2) 9850 8212 Fax: 9850 8174Macquarie University,          Email gjoss@rna.bio.mq.edu.auNorth Ryde, (Sydney,) NSW 2109, AustraliaFrom nih-image-d-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Sep  1 00:32 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id AAA13915;	Tue, 1 Sep 1998 00:32:35 -0400 (EDT)Date: Tue, 1 Sep 1998 00:32:35 -0400 (EDT)From: nih-image-d-request@io.ece.drexel.eduMessage-Id: <199809010432.AAA13915@io.ECE.Drexel.EDU>Subject: nih-image-d Digest V98 #49X-Loop: nih-image-d@biomed.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image-d@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/volume98/49Precedence: listMIME-Version: 1.0To: nih-image-d@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: multipart/digest; boundary="----------------------------"Content-Length: 17535------------------------------Content-Type: text/plainnih-image-d Digest				Volume 98 : Issue 49Today's Topics:  Re: Pausing a macro to draw a freeha  [ Laird Bloom <lbloom@MIT.EDU> ]  integration of dim fluorescent signa  [ "Dr. Ron Goldstein" <goldst@mail.bi ]  writing macros                        [ "Linda J.

Essentially, I write themacro in a way that expects there to be an open image file at thestart, and then after doing the measurement procedures, closes or savesthe current image and opens the next one.  I also set up the macro so Ican start it with a single keystroke (using [x] in the macro title,where x is a single key).  That way it's fairly straightforward to drawyour ROI and press a key, then have the computer do measurements andopen your next slice for you.  	I often do this in conjunction with two other macros, one to setinitial parameters (type of measurements, name of file for savingresults, etc.) and open the first image, the other to analyze the datain the results file after the individual images have been measured. Below is an example we use for capturing live video images andmeasuring the areas of a number of freehand ROIs from each of a numberof images, then saving each area in a file.  In this case, the "MeasureArea[M]" macro is used multiple times for multiple ROIs in a singleimage, and then the<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger><bigger>'New view of current sample [v]'</bigger></bigger></fontfamily> macrogets rid of the current image and has the computer acquire a new one,using the GetImageToMeasure procedure.  Like the old VW ads:  it'sugly, but it gets you there.Good luck.Laird BloomMIT Center for Cancer Research<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger><bigger>{  We use Scion Image1.62, essentially the same as NIH Image 1.61. You may need to modifythe StartCapturing and StopCapturing commands if the "measure areas onscope" macro, depending on the source of your input.  Excerpt from labprotocol book precedes the macro code.<bold>"Measure areas on scope" macro</bold>	It is sometimes convenient to measure areas on many parts of asample without having to save each image and reopen it.  To do this andsave the areas as a set of numbers suitable for import into Excel, loadthe "Measure areas on scope" macro file.  Data are saved as a singlecolumn of numbers for each sample, which can be copied and pasted intoa single column in Excel.	To start, be sure to close the video camera window.   Then type P orpull down the "Set up measurement parameters" macro.  It will ask youwhether you want to save each image before and after labeling areas,and then it will ask you for the name of your first sample and beginshowing live video images.  When you have found the image you want,click the mouse button or press the shift, option, or control keys. (You may have to hold the key or mouse button down for a fraction of asecond or push it a second time.)  Then select a drawing tool, drawaround an area you wish to measure, and press the M key when you'reready.  The area of each region in pixels (this can be changed to mm,etc from the pulldown menus) will show up in a text file on the rightof the screen and is saved after each entry.  Be careful if you modifythis file while adding data to it (e.g., if the font is too large tolet you see all your data); if the text is still highlighted when youmeasure your next area, all of the highlighted data will be deleted(based on sad but true experience).   Keep drawing and pressing M untilyou're done with that image.  Then press V (or pull down "New view ofthis sample" macro), get your next image, and continue.  To scoreanother sample (and save the counts in a new file), press S or pulldown "Score next sample" macro.  You can open this file in Excel, orcopy and paste as a single column into a single Excel file for all ofyou data (more convenient).}{"Measure areas on scope" macro file follows:modified area measurement macro--use while measuring areas while atmicroscope.

Do Ihave to write a user interface so that they can signify what measurementsto use (ie. they make a mistake and measure the perimeter again) and tosignal when each slide is finished?

I looked on the Image home page and foundthere was a version 1.62b20 for Code Warrior Pro 2. I recently bought CodeWarrior Pro 3 which I installed on a Windows 95 machine. I was wondering ifthere was any version of the Image source code that would compile usingCode Warrior Pro 3 (or if there isn't one now if there might be one in thenear future). In addition, since Code Warrior Pro 3 allows you to compileprojects for multiple targets, will it ever be possible to obtain sourcecode that I could use with Code Warrior Pro 3 to compile a version of Imageto run on a Windows machine?  Sorry for being greedy, but a version of thesource code that would allow me to compile an extended version of Image fora Windows machine would be of great value to me (and I assume to others aswell). Bill Boskingbillb@neuro.duke.edu919-684-8510 phone919-684-4431 FAX------------------------------Date:          Tue, 1 Sep 1998 14:23:13 GMT+1000From: GJOSS@rna.bio.mq.edu.auTo: goldst@mail.biu.ac.il, nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduSubject:       Re: integration of dim fluorescent signalsMessage-ID: <761767A26AC@rna.bio.mq.edu.au>>Date: Mon, 31 Aug 1998 15:38:38 +0300>To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu>From: "Dr. Ron Goldstein" <goldst@mail.biu.ac.il>>Subject: integration of dim fluorescent signals>>I have been having trouble figuring out how to use the integration function>of the Averaging menu in Image.

These give the range of the actual (integrated) sum of pixel values as stored in the intermediate temporary real image which would then be scaled to set max=254, min=1 (not 255,0).Using "Fix Scale" your own offset and scale values are used.For n=8, the maximum accumulated pixel value would be 256n = 2048so "Fix Scale",0,1024 would achieve your requested result.In practice you would probably find a non-zero minimum (which you can read off the Info window. (Re)Entry of the values min,min+1024 would then result in better contrast.Better still, inspect the histogram of the captured integrated image to see where the "real" max/min are ie the range of interest excluding backround, outliers or highlights. It is then practical (if not always straight forward) to set min/max values to maximising useful contrast in converting from the internal real value image to the 8 bit result.You can test this at the macro level by imageing print on paper ("black" on "white") with integration checked. With video controls gain/offset set correctly (or regardless) and "Fix Scale" not checked, the histogram should range 1-254 (0,255 vacant). ShowHistogram should then enable you to see the histogram pixel range which corresponds to the "white" paper.Select a ROI which excludes text (ie white paper only) and capture again. The Info window will report the min/max of the integrated ROI ie paper only.Feeding these values back into a "Fix Scale" integration will give you a high contrast image of the "white" paper (with the print saturated black and effectively ignored in this contrast range).Greg Joss,School of Biological Sciences, Phone:(61)(2) 9850 8212 Fax: 9850 8174Macquarie University,          Email gjoss@rna.bio.mq.edu.auNorth Ryde, (Sydney,) NSW 2109, Australia--------------------------------End of nih-image-d Digest V98 Issue #49***************************************From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Sep  1 11:57 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id LAA06472;	Tue, 1 Sep 1998 11:56:52 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Tue, 1 Sep 1998 11:56:52 -0400 (EDT)Message-Id: <v03020901b211ba121d2e@[18.155.0.104]>In-Reply-To: <3.0.4.32.19980831101943.00b41388@130.91.91.1>Mime-Version: 1.0Date: Tue, 1 Sep 1998 10:06:10 -0500To: "Linda J.

The general structure that works for meis to have individual macros that can be run by a single keystroke (byincluding [x] in the macro name, where x is any key), each of whichinstructs the computer to make a single measurement, write it to a datafile, increment a counter, and return to the image.  I also have a macrofor setting parameters (sample names, name of results files, etc.) andopening the initial image, and a second macro that calculates averages,etc.for the data file when the slide is completely scored. It's fairly simpleto teach people to use macros written this way; they just have to rememberwhich keys to press to score which parameters.  The user can outline areason the image and choose not to measure them if they make a mistake.  (I'mnot sure there's an easy way to undo mistakes).	As for recording data,  writing each data point for a singleparameter as a single column of numbers works nicely for import into Excel(just select all, copy, and paste into Excel, no reformatting needed).  Ifyou're scoring multiple parameters, I would suggest setting up multipledata files.  The transition to Excel is somewhat cumbersome, since you haveto copy and paste each file separately, but there's no editing needed onceyou get there.  Alternately, you can write your data to a single text fileand open the whole thing in Excel, deleting extra cells as needed.	An alternative might be to record data in the two rUser arrays andthen write a procedure to write each value (or just the averages) to a textfile; unfortunately, there are only two arrays available.	You'll find code for one set of macros written like this, formeasuring outlined areas, in the same nih-image-d Digest V98 #42 set inwhich your inquiry appeared; see my message about pausing macros in thatset, or contact me directly for the code.Laird BloomMIT Center for Cancer Research>Hello,>I have been asked to write a macro for some clinicians here at our vet>hospital.

The general structure that works for meis to have individual macros that can be run by a single keystroke (byincluding [x] in the macro name, where x is any key), each of whichinstructs the computer to make a single measurement, write it to a datafile, increment a counter, and return to the image.  I also have a macrofor setting parameters (sample names, name of results files, etc.) andopening the initial image, and a second macro that calculates averages,etc.for the data file when the slide is completely scored. It's fairly simpleto teach people to use macros written this way; they just have to rememberwhich keys to press to score which parameters.  The user can outline areason the image and choose not to measure them if they make a mistake.  (I'mnot sure there's an easy way to undo mistakes).	As for recording data,  writing each data point for a singleparameter as a single column of numbers works nicely for import into Excel(just select all, copy, and paste into Excel, no reformatting needed).  Ifyou're scoring multiple parameters, I would suggest setting up multipledata files.  The transition to Excel is somewhat cumbersome, since you haveto copy and paste each file separately, but there's no editing needed onceyou get there.  Alternately, you can write your data to a single text fileand open the whole thing in Excel, deleting extra cells as needed.	An alternative might be to record data in the two rUser arrays andthen write a procedure to write each value (or just the averages) to a textfile; unfortunately, there are only two arrays available.	You'll find code for one set of macros written like this, formeasuring outlined areas, in the same nih-image-d Digest V98 #42 set inwhich your inquiry appeared; see my message about pausing macros in thatset, or contact me directly for the code.Laird BloomMIT Center for Cancer Research>Hello,>I have been asked to write a macro for some clinicians here at our vet>hospital.

Like, slice1.tif, slice2.tif, slice3.tif etc. I have tried>saveas('slice'+slicenumber), but it wants only a string.>Use saveas('slice',slicenumber:2,'.tif') for a sequence slice01.tif etc.The syntax of using a + operator in strings works only in Turbo Pascal.In NIH image you can use concat() to merge a series of strings, or insertthem directly in commands that expects a single string parameter.Hope this helps.+---------------------------------------------------------+|  Stein Roervik   (steinr@chembio.ntnu.no)               ||                                                         ||  Research Scientist, Computer Assisted Microscopy       ||  Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Norwegian University of  ||  Science and Technology, N-7034 Trondheim, Norway       ||  tel. +47 73 59 39 88, fax +47 73 59 08 60              |+---------------------------------------------------------+From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Wed Sep  2 05:15 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id FAA12073;	Wed, 2 Sep 1998 05:15:12 -0400 (EDT) <v03007803b211e07621ac@[128.231.99.216]> <3.0.5.32.19980831121648.007d4100@neuro.duke.edu>Resent-Date: Wed, 2 Sep 1998 05:15:12 -0400 (EDT)X-Sender: steinr@pop.chembio.ntnu.noMessage-Id: <v03102809b212b7c80817@[129.241.39.133]>In-Reply-To: <l03110700b211fcb653c2@[145.18.160.48]>References: <l03010d00b21216a2ed30@[145.18.29.76]> <v03007803b211e07621ac@[128.231.99.216]> <3.0.5.32.19980831121648.007d4100@neuro.duke.edu>Mime-Version: 1.0Date: Wed, 2 Sep 1998 11:02:33 +0200To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduFrom: Stein Roervik <steinr@chembio.ntnu.no>Subject: Re: Code Warrior Pro 3Resent-Message-ID: <"hEeSg2.0.FT2._ZGxr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/283X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"Content-Length: 1978>I had problems with NIH Image and CodeWorrior 3: in the 68k project, the>'StringOf' function did not work, with the effect that many strings showed>garbage or nothing.

The format specifications (tiff 5.0 last time I looked) allow forso much variability that special features such as multi-image or 16 bitfiles are almost never supported outside of their native program.<P>As others have commented here in the past, the only truely portableformat is the single image tiff format.<P>Good luck transferring,<P>Lance<P>-----------------------------<BR>Lance Davidson<BR>Research Associate (postdoc)<BR>Department of Biology<BR>University of Virginia<BR>Charlottesville, VA 22903<BR>804-243-2596</HTML>--------------BC7C11B71928C9E56283692C----------------------------------End of nih-image-d Digest V98 Issue #54***************************************From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Sun Sep  6 12:16 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id MAA09665;	Sun, 6 Sep 1998 12:15:50 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Sun, 6 Sep 1998 12:15:50 -0400 (EDT)Message-ID: <009001bdd9af$71afe920$0f0a13c0@oemcomputer>From: "Joan Main" <joan.main@gte.net>To: "scion image" <nih-image@io.ece.drexel.edu>Subject: Fw: scion image histogram plotsDate: Sun, 6 Sep 1998 09:00:16 -0700MIME-Version: 1.0Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitX-Priority: 3X-MSMail-Priority: NormalX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 4.72.3110.1X-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V4.72.3110.3Resent-Message-ID: <"8Soye2.0.I22.DBhyr"@io>Resent-From: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/latest/306X-Loop: nih-image@biomed.drexel.eduPrecedence: listResent-Sender: nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: text/plain;	charset="iso-8859-1"Content-Length: 1105-----Original Message-----From: Joan Main <jmain@acuson.com>To: joan.main@gte.net <joan.main@gte.net>Date: Wednesday, September 02, 1998 3:46 PMSubject: scion image histogram plots>     Hi,>     I have a very urgent question regarding measurements:>>        1.

It is excellent forrelatively low light fluorescence, and maintains pretty high resolution aswell. Image analysis with a IP systems software is very friently interfaceto the camera and enables very easy scripting of routines. The camera withIP software runs about $28,000; there is now an attachement unit that cancapture the image using a liquid crystal mechanism that will achieve colorfor brightfield as well. The capture of phase images is superb with thatsystem as well. (I am a big fan of Nikon's Eclipse microscopes for thescope in that it has such wonderful light transmission for fluorescence)and your system should then run about $55,000-$60,000 for the scope withthe best objectives and a variety of fluorescence cubes.

To analyze, make a copy of your delineations and use thedensity slice to isolate one of the regions. Use AND when pasting to yourFITC image to restrict analysis to the ROI. Repeat for each of yourdelineations. To associate the ROI name with the measurement,  write theresults to a text window along with the ROI name.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Jonathan Nissanov, Ph.D.                                      Associate Director            Computer Vision Center for Vertebrate Brain Mapping,                a NIH Biomedical Research Technology Resource                                http://cbis.ece.drexel.edu/ICVC/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Imaging and Computer Vision Center              Tel: 215-895-1381Drexel University                                                   Fax:215-895-4987Phildelphia, PA 19104yoni@coe.drexel.edu -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     And remember, the early bird may get the worm, but the second mousegets the cheese.From nih-image-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Tue Sep  8 17:12 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id RAA02245;	Tue, 8 Sep 1998 17:11:54 -0400 (EDT)Resent-Date: Tue, 8 Sep 1998 17:11:54 -0400 (EDT)Date: Tue, 8 Sep 1998 13:57:21 -0700 (PDT)From: "G.

You dodn't say whether the Canon camera was a digital camera or a video camera with a framgrabber. For a specialised application like this,I would expect that you would potentially get better results with a good monochrome camera (<$1000 US) with an appropriate color filter and a Scion framegrabber(<$1000).It is important to look at and understand the histogram.  I will attach an annoted version to a direct email.The histogram spread ranges from 25 or 28 (the bright end)to 248 (the dark end)The peak centered around 238 is not image data but the spread of pixels forming a black border around the image.The image itself has a maximum pixel value of about 210.Hence your image contrast range is at best 210-25 = 185out of the available 256 values ie 72% of availableWhen you look at the histogram taken when density slice is active, the sliced portion of the histogram is shown in black as opposed to gray for the background.Your slice extends from 25 or 28 to 47 and is <860 pixels of the total 320x240=76800 pixels and is part of an image segment roughly 60 pixels diameter which is much brighter than the background image of the retina but only occupies about 5% of the image and on the histogram is all represented in the low outliers to the left of the double peaked histogram of the main retina.You can see that if your image histogram was spread to fit the available 256 values, then you would have much better contrast discrimination for the bright region of the retina.You should be able to arrange this by adjustment of the brightness,contrast, colour balance controls on the camera if digital or on the framegrabber.If a framegrabber, then, under NIH-Image, set a live histogram while you live capture and you adjust the gain(video control dialogue) up until the histogram is as wide as the histogram window while keeping it in the window by adjusting the offset (down will move it left in window, up will move it right towards the dark end).More extremely, as you know where your region of interest falls on the histogram you can adjust the contrast ie gain up as long as the live histogram remains reasonably stable and keeping the histogram roi within the window by adjusting offset. This will saturate the retina background to be very dark or even black ie >=255 but will maximise discrimination in the intensity range that is of interest for the density slice segmentation.Also if you make a selection that is restricted to the bright region andthen use integrate, the integration processing will ensure the max/min levels in the ROI fill the histogram window.If you need to retain contrast info to see blood vessel detail of current image, the you can expand a range of 25 to 25+166= to 256 by cutting off the dark end of the histogram where 191 falls now ie an improvement of 256/166=1.5+ or over 50%or you can take two images with different contrast settings and transfer the segmented ROI from the image contrasted at the bright endto the perceptually acceptable image afterwards.Greg Joss,School of Biological Sciences, Phone:(61)(2) 9850 8212 Fax: 9850 8174Macquarie University,          Email gjoss@rna.bio.mq.edu.auNorth Ryde, (Sydney,) NSW 2109, AustraliaFrom nih-image-d-request@io.ece.drexel.edu Wed Sep  9 00:23 EDT 1998Received: (from lists@localhost)	by io.ECE.Drexel.EDU (8.8.8/8.8.8) id AAA17221;	Wed, 9 Sep 1998 00:23:45 -0400 (EDT)Date: Wed, 9 Sep 1998 00:23:45 -0400 (EDT)From: nih-image-d-request@io.ece.drexel.eduMessage-Id: <199809090423.AAA17221@io.ECE.Drexel.EDU>Subject: nih-image-d Digest V98 #57X-Loop: nih-image-d@biomed.drexel.eduX-Mailing-List: <nih-image-d@biomed.drexel.edu> archive/volume98/57Precedence: listMIME-Version: 1.0To: nih-image-d@io.ece.drexel.eduReply-To: nih-image@io.ece.drexel.eduContent-Type: multipart/digest; boundary="----------------------------"Content-Length: 23108------------------------------Content-Type: text/plainnih-image-d Digest				Volume 98 : Issue 57Today's Topics:  question                              [ Luthero Martins <rsf6675@pro.via-rs ]  Transferring ROIs to a new image      [ Laird Bloom <lbloom@MIT.EDU> ]  Re: Transferring ROIs to a new image  [ Doug Morris <dmorris@bmrl.med.uiuc. ]  image analysis setup                  [ Gloria Hoffman <gehoffma@umaryland. ]  Re: image analysis setup              [ Sam Purdy <spurdy@nationalsteel.com ]  Re: image analysis setup              [ Sam Purdy <spurdy@nationalsteel.com ]  Epson Photo 700 printers              [ "Randy M.

To analyze, make a copy of your delineations and use thedensity slice to isolate one of the regions. Use AND when pasting to yourFITC image to restrict analysis to the ROI. Repeat for each of yourdelineations. To associate the ROI name with the measurement,  write theresults to a text window along with the ROI name.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Jonathan Nissanov, Ph.D.                                      Associate Director            Computer Vision Center for Vertebrate Brain Mapping,                a NIH Biomedical Research Technology Resource                                http://cbis.ece.drexel.edu/ICVC/-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Imaging and Computer Vision Center              Tel: 215-895-1381Drexel University                                                   Fax:215-895-4987Phildelphia, PA 19104yoni@coe.drexel.edu -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     And remember, the early bird may get the worm, but the second mousegets the cheese.------------------------------Date: Tue, 8 Sep 1998 13:57:21 -0700 (PDT)From: "G.

You dodn't say whether the Canon camera was a digital camera or a video camera with a framgrabber. For a specialised application like this,I would expect that you would potentially get better results with a good monochrome camera (<$1000 US) with an appropriate color filter and a Scion framegrabber(<$1000).It is important to look at and understand the histogram.  I will attach an annoted version to a direct email.The histogram spread ranges from 25 or 28 (the bright end)to 248 (the dark end)The peak centered around 238 is not image data but the spread of pixels forming a black border around the image.The image itself has a maximum pixel value of about 210.Hence your image contrast range is at best 210-25 = 185out of the available 256 values ie 72% of availableWhen you look at the histogram taken when density slice is active, the sliced portion of the histogram is shown in black as opposed to gray for the background.Your slice extends from 25 or 28 to 47 and is <860 pixels of the total 320x240=76800 pixels and is part of an image segment roughly 60 pixels diameter which is much brighter than the background image of the retina but only occupies about 5% of the image and on the histogram is all represented in the low outliers to the left of the double peaked histogram of the main retina.You can see that if your image histogram was spread to fit the available 256 values, then you would have much better contrast discrimination for the bright region of the retina.You should be able to arrange this by adjustment of the brightness,contrast, colour balance controls on the camera if digital or on the framegrabber.If a framegrabber, then, under NIH-Image, set a live histogram while you live capture and you adjust the gain(video control dialogue) up until the histogram is as wide as the histogram window while keeping it in the window by adjusting the offset (down will move it left in window, up will move it right towards the dark end).More extremely, as you know where your region of interest falls on the histogram you can adjust the contrast ie gain up as long as the live histogram remains reasonably stable and keeping the histogram roi within the window by adjusting offset. This will saturate the retina background to be very dark or even black ie >=255 but will maximise discrimination in the intensity range that is of interest for the density slice segmentation.Also if you make a selection that is restricted to the bright region andthen use integrate, the integration processing will ensure the max/min levels in the ROI fill the histogram window.If you need to retain contrast info to see blood vessel detail of current image, the you can expand a range of 25 to 25+166= to 256 by cutting off the dark end of the histogram where 191 falls now ie an improvement of 256/166=1.5+ or over 50%or you can take two images with different contrast settings and transfer the segmented ROI from the image contrasted at the bright endto the perceptually acceptable image afterwards.Greg Joss,School of Biological Sciences, Phone:(61)(2) 9850 8212 Fax: 9850 8174Macquarie University,          Email gjoss@rna.bio.mq.edu.auNorth Ryde, (Sydney,) NSW 2109, Australia--------------------------------End of nih-image-d Digest V98 Issue #57***************************************
